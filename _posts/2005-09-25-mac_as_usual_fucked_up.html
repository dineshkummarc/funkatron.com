<p>I was tricked (and by tricked, I mean they waited until I updated my credit card info to buy some music from the iTMS, and then renewed my account immediately) into renewing my almost never used .Mac account.  I kinda dug it when they were doing stuff like releasing free software to .Mac users, but lately the only cool stuff we got as members were bandwidth limitations.  Poor.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I got the renewal notice, I decided to check up on whether or not anything mildly cool happened with .Mac lately.  Coincidentally, I renewed exactly at the same time they upped the storage to 1GB, added the &#8220;Groups&#8221; features, and released Backup 3 (because who would need backup software if you didn&#8217;t have an iDisk?)</p>

<p>I actually haven&#8217;t tried either yet, because I don&#8217;t see much use for making a group only accessible to other .Mac users, and Backup 2 sucked so deeply and tightly that I throw up a little every time it&#8217;s mentioned.  I don&#8217;t get why Apple didn&#8217;t just pay <a href="http://www.dantz.com/">Dantz</a> for a &#8220;lite&#8221; version of Retrospect , because as ass-backwards as the UI was the last time I tried it, it at least seemed to function.</p>

<p>Anyway, not surprisingly, reports on MacInTouch are that shit&#8217;s wonky with the .Mac groups.  First off:</p>

<blockquote>So somebody who creates a free .Mac ID and lets the .Mac trial expire can continue to participate fully in a .Mac group, but a paying user of an email-only account cannnot. Something is wrong with this picture. </blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s not so much &#8220;wonky&#8221; as &#8220;par for the course.&#8221;  Anyway, here&#8217;s some more dumb crap:</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;my Dad saw the invitation, looked at the &#8220;sign up for a free .Mac trial&#8221; page it sent him to, and closed the browser. When we later figured out that this was the only way to join, and that it wouldn&#8217;t cost money (as we had initially thought), he started up Firefox, went to www.mac.com and created a trial account. Of course, this new account couldn&#8217;t join the group until I sent it an invitation. Whups! If you don&#8217;t create your new .Mac ID directly from the invitation email, it isn&#8217;t connected to the group.</blockquote>

<p>Truly, the masters of user experience.</p>

<p>As for crap that&#8217;s broken in Backup 3:</p>

<blockquote>I run Backup and select Restore and follow the appropriate prompts and insert the CD and the Restore job appears to run but it takes only about a third of a second and then declares it was &#8220;successful.&#8221; But there are no new files on the destination machine. I&#8217;ve tried restoring to the iTunes folder, and also restoring to an alternate location, same result. No error message, but nothing is restored, either.</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;and&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>I made a 10-disc CD backup of my iTunes library and tonight had to do a restore. The same thing happened to me as did to him: after following Backup&#8217;s procedure, it tells me I had a &#8220;successful&#8221; backup and nothings there.</blockquote>

<p>Man, that is awesome.  I feel better about my renewal already.</p>
