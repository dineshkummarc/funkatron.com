<blockquote>Dutch viewer Frank Tiggelaar writes:<br /><br /><blockquote>There was a striking dicrepancy between the CNN International report on the Bush visit to the New Orleans disaster zone, yesterday, and reports of the same event by German TV.<br /><br />ZDF News reported that the president&#8217;s visit was a completely staged event. Their crew witnessed how <b>the open air food distribution point Bush visited in front of the cameras was torn down immediately after the president and the herd of &#8216;news people&#8217; had left</b> and that others which were allegedly being set up were abandoned at the same time.<br /><br />The people in the area were once again left to fend for themselves, said ZDF.</blockquote></blockquote>
