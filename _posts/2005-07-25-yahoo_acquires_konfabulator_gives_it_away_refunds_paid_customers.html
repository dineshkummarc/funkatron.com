<p>This is really kickass.  I&#8217;m running it on my Windows desktop as we speak, and will probably be putting it on my iBook as well.  I&#8217;m even motivated to fix the compatibility issues in my old RSS Viewer widget that I wrote a couple years back.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/mc/20050725/tc_mc/yahooacquireskonfabulator">Yahoo! acquires Konfabulator - Yahoo! News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O). on Monday will announce the acquisition of Konfabulator, a Macintosh and Windows application that allows users to run mini files known as Widgets on their desktop &#8212; the same model used by Apple for its Dashboard application. Yahoo! company executives said they would also be giving Konfabulator away for free, completely doing away with the US$19.95 currently charged for the product.</blockquote>
