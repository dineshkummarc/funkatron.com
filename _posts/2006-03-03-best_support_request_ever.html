<blockquote>The following message passed through our trouble reporting queue this morning (names have been changed to protect the ignorant):<br /><br /><br /></blockquote>

<blockquote>From: [deleted]@cs.purdue.edu<br /> Subject:  [Purdue CS #44332] CPU off in the morning<br /> Date:  March 3, 2006 8:15:08 AM EST<br /> To: [deleted]@cs.purdue.edu, [deleted]@cs.purdue.edu<br /><br />For the second morning in a row my CPU was off when I arrived in the morning.<br />As always, I select &#8220;Shut Down&#8221; when I leave at night. Thought it was a fluke<br />the yesterday but now know it must be something else.<br /><br />User<br /></blockquote>
