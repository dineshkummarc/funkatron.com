<p><a href="http://www.usabilitynews.org/">Usability News - Feb 2005</a></p>

<p>Usability News has tons of <em>really</em> useful info for folks who care about usability &#8212; and if you are at all involved in making things that human being interact with, you need to care about it.  From the home page:</p>

<blockquote>Usability News  is a free web newsletter that is produced by the <a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/">Software Usability Research Laboratory (SURL)</a>. The SURL team specializes in software/website user interface design research, human-computer interaction research, and usability testing and research.</blockquote>

<p>Probably the most significant advantage the SURL stuff has over a lot of other usability info is that it&#8217;s actually based in proper scientific research, rather than the usual &#8220;common sense&#8221; approach.  One of the best examples of that is <em><a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/62/web_object_international.htm">Preliminary Examination of Global Expectations of Users&#8217; Mental Models for E-Commerce Web Layouts</a></em>, a really interesting study that examines where people from different parts of the world expect common e-commerce web objects to appear, like the &#8220;Shopping Cart&#8221; icon and &#8220;Home&#8221; link.  Stuff like this gives an interface designer real evidence to back up his or her layout choices.</p>
