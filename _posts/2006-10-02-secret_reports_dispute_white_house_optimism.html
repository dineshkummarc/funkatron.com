<p>from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/30/AR2006093000293.html">The Washington Post:</a><br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made three tragic decisions,&#8221; Garner told Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Rumsfeld asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three terrible mistakes,&#8221; Garner said.</p>
<p>He cited the first two orders Bremer signed when he arrived, the first one banning as many as 50,000 members of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Baath Party from government jobs and the second disbanding the Iraqi military. Now there were hundreds of thousands of disorganized, unemployed, armed Iraqis running around.</p>
<p>Third, Garner said, Bremer had summarily dismissed an interim Iraqi leadership group that had been eager to help the United States administer the country in the short term. &#8220;Jerry Bremer can&#8217;t be the face of the government to the Iraqi people. You&#8217;ve got to have an Iraqi face for the Iraqi people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garner made his final point: &#8220;There&#8217;s still time to rectify this. There&#8217;s still time to turn it around.&#8221;</p>
Rumsfeld looked at Garner for a moment with his take-no-prisoners gaze. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is anything we can do, because we are where we are.&#8221;<br /><br />He thinks I&#8217;ve lost it, Garner thought. He thinks I&#8217;m absolutely wrong. Garner didn&#8217;t want it to sound like sour grapes, but facts were facts. &#8220;They&#8217;re all reversible,&#8221; Garner said again.<br /><br />&#8221;<strong>We&#8217;re not going to go back</strong>,&#8221; Rumsfeld said emphatically. </blockquote>
