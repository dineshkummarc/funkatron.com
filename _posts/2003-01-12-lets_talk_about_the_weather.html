<p>Right now my Powerbook tells me it is 10 degrees fahrenheit [happy now chelle? 8)] outside.  It&#8217;s also sunny, which means that 
if it
was not sunny, it would be -700.  I wouldn&#8217;t know either way, because I don&#8217;t go outside &#8212; it&#8217;s overrated.</p>

<p>
Some people will say, &#8220;Ed, why a blog?  What happened to your music
stuff?  Are you a sucker?&#8221;  The answer to the latter should be obvious,
but as for the first two: </p>

<ol>
 <li>I&#8217;m a follower, not a leader</li>
 <li>I haven&#8217;t
written music in a long time, and I&#8217;m not sure I will anytime soon.  I
spend my time programming now, and taking care of my son</li>
</ol>

<p>Back to the weather.  I live in Lafayette, IN, which some people
seem to think is the South.  Anyone from the actual South will laugh in
your face when they see your &#8220;Hoosier by birth, Southern by the grace
of God&#8221; license plate, but some people still insist.  For their sake,
here&#8217;s a helpful cheat sheet to determine if you&#8217;re in the south:</p>

<ul>

 <li>If you balls just froze to your boxers, you&#8217;re not in the south</li>
</ul>

<p>I keep seeing <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cheadle,+Don">Don Cheadle</a> doing these NFL Playoffs commercials.  Now I 
<b>LOVE</b>
Don Cheadle.  He rules.  He&#8217;s one of my favorite actors ever.  But Don
(in case you&#8217;re reading), you&#8217;re not Sam Jackson.  Sam will always be
Jules.  If you&#8217;re gonna do these things, you need to bring Rocket, the
crazy Crip from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094894">Colors</a>, or Mouse, the crazy guy in a suit from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0112857">Devil in a Blue Dress</a>, or Snoopy, the crazy prison inmate from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120780">Out of Sight</a>.  You do not want to bring Buck Swopes from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118749">Boogie Nights</a>.  Yes, Buck got laid all the time, but he was also a nerd, and 
Raiders fans will beat him up.</p>
