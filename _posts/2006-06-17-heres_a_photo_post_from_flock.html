<p><br />  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/39241541@N00/168914282"><br />    <img alt="A blurry self-photo before giving a presentation" src="http://static.flickr.com/66/168914282_54b2317923_m.jpg" /><br />  </a><br /></p>

<p>I had to drag this photo from my flickr photostream in the main flock windows &#8212; it looks like I couldn&#8217;t take a photo from, say, my Desktop or iPhoto.  I hope that changes in the future.<br /> </p>
