<blockquote>Wedgewood Middle School educators drank booze during the school day, got kinky with each other in the boiler room bathroom, and spoke about where to score cocaine.</blockquote>

<p><br />[&#8230;]<br /></p>

<blockquote>Baker told investigators that last May she spotted Terry &#8220;in the Boiler room restroom pulling her pants down with the door open and [Koeller] went into the restroom and started kissing Abbi and doing other things.&#8221; Baker also said that on the last day of school in 2004, she observed Terry &#8220;doing a seductive dance&#8221; for Koeller in the principal&#8217;s office. Before she began gyrating, Terry had removed her shirt, &#8220;leaving herself in a bra only,&#8221; said Baker. The probe of the Wedgewood hijinks was aided by information provided by Terry&#8217;s estranged husband, who blamed Koeller for stealing his wife away from him. <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0921051school10.html">In a letter</a> to the executive director of Columbus&#8217;s school system, David Terry branded Koeller &#8220;an alcoholic, a drug abuser, a liar, and a wife stealer.&#8221; He noted that Koeller once told him that she smoked pot daily en route to school because &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand those kids.</blockquote>
