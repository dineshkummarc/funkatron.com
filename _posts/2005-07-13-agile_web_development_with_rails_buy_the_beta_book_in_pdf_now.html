<blockquote>What the Pragmatic Programmers did with their new book on Rails is wonderful: they started selling it as a PDF when still in BETA - to please the eager, and get feedback/typos.</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty damn cool, and worked quite nicely: my PDF download was ready just a few minutes after ordering.  I&#8217;m anxious to try out Rails, but I was waiting for this book so I wouldn&#8217;t be as frustrated trying to hunt down solutions to problems in various places on the web (problems I likely already know how to solve in PHP).</p>
