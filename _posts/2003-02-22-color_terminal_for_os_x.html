<p>I&#8217;ve often been frustrated with the fact that OS X&#8217;s Terminal doesn&#8217;t by default support proper text coloring.  The main issue has been with supporting syntax coloring in <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a>, which I use to edit files at work when I&#8217;m at home and outside work&#8217;s firewall/behind my NAT router.  I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where not having syntax coloring sends me into fits of rage, so for the sake of my family, it was important that I find a solution.</p>

<p>(It <i>is</i> true that you can <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020408225741777">change your term emu to vt100-color</a>, but then you have to do this on all the machines you ssh to as well, which isn&#8217;t really a good idea when you&#8217;re using a shared account like I am.)</p>

<p>Anyway, somebody mentioned a Terminal replacement for OS X called <a href="http://www.pollet.net/GLterm/">GLterm</a>.  On a practical level, GLterm is cool because it supports ANSI color right out of the chute.  On a nerd level, GLterm is cool because it uses OpenGL to display everything.  It&#8217;s super fast &#8212; a lot faster than Terminal &#8212; and it feels more like a traditional UNIX terminal because it uses those old-skool fonts.</p>

<p>There are a couple less cool things about it.  It doesn&#8217;t support transparency, which I actually sometimes find practical when I&#8217;m transcribing something from a window behind Terminal.  It also costs $10, which isn&#8217;t a lot, but it feels a little pricey considering it doesn&#8217;t really offer a lot of new features.  So I haven&#8217;t bought it yet, but I&#8217;m thinking about it.  If you&#8217;re a bigtime CLI jockey, though, you might find this just the ticket.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I prefer iTerm, mainly because it is free+open software. &lt;a href=&#8221;http://iterm.sf.net&#8221;&gt;http://iterm.sf.net&lt;/a&gt; is its homepage. It has decent colour support, but it <em>is</em> a work in progress, so YMMV, of course.</p>
