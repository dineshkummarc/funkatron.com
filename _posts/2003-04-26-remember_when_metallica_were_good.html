<p>I do.  They put out four albums in the 80s that varied from <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Kill_em_all.shtml">very good but corny</a> to <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/And_justice_for_all.shtml">fucking amazing</a>.  Then the 90s rolled around, and they did one <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Metallica.shtml">kinda okay album</a>, and two <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Load.shtml">which made</a> <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Re_load.shtml">me cry</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my opinion, the 90s downslide wasn&#8217;t so much the instrumentation, which varied from kinda okay to occasionally quite good, but the lyrics and vocals.  Let&#8217;s compare the former:</p>

<ul><li>
&#8220;Blackened&#8221;, 1988<br />
<i> Blackened Is the End<br />
Winter it Will Send<br /></i>
<p></p></il>

<li>
&#8220;I Disappear&#8221;, 2000<br />
<i>Hey Hey Hey<br />
Here I go now<br /></i>
<p></p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>What the hell?</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>As for the vocals, Hetfield has certainly increased his singing ability and vocal range, but he also started saying &#8220;oooh&#8221; and &#8220;yeah!&#8221; a lot.  Rob Zombie pulls off &#8220;yeah,&#8221; but James just doesn&#8217;t.  It sounds wimpy, especially when he sings old songs (their perfomance of &#8220;Fade to Black&#8221; at the VH1 Music Awards a couple years ago actually made the <i>original</i> version unlistenable for a few months)</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway, the three remaining members of Metallica have a new album coming out soon called <i>St. Anger</i>.  The word on the street is that it&#8217;s supposed to be a return to the pre-suck era.  I first read this on the MTVNews site, and was fairly suspicious, since the guy who wrote the article probably thought the last Limp Bizkit album had &#8220;killer riffs.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.encycmet.biz/news/2003-04-02.shtml">But this review</a> translated from <a href="http://www.closeupmagazine.net/metallica.php">a Swedish mag called Close-Up</a> was also very positive about the album, and I&#8217;m about a trillion times more likely to trust a Swede &#8212; any Swede &#8212; about metal than I am a guy whose career ambition is to follow in the footsteps of Gideon Yago.  I do find it odd that they did this after the only guy in the band who seemed to remember what was cool about Metallilca left, but hey, maybe they&#8217;re doing coke again.</p>
