<p>So in the past couple days we&#8217;ve gotten two new browser releases for OS X: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino (ex-Chimera) 0.7</a>, and Safari 1.0 b64.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Camino 0.7 doesn&#8217;t make any groundbreaking improvements, but it does seem to be a little faster.  It has a kinda swank download manager, but I&#8217;ve almost always found those things a waste of time.  It apparently can do auto-discovery of local web and ftp servers via Rendezvous, but I haven&#8217;t actually seen it work yet (I&#8217;m probably missing something though).  And I still can&#8217;t seem to do type ahead find with it, which I take advantage of with Phoenix on Win32.  Still, Camino remains my main browser.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Safari 1.0 b64 isn&#8217;t a public release, so no linking to it will be done here (I&#8217;m purely a leech), but if you look around on <a href="http://arstechnica.infopop.net/OpenTopic/page?a=frm&s=50009562&f=8300945231">message boards</a> you&#8217;ll find it without too much trouble.  The major new thing is tabbed browsing, which first appeared in b62 (also not a public release), and has been refined a bit here.  Tabs were really the main reason I wasn&#8217;t using Safari, and their appearance here makes it much more competitive with Camino.  Plus, I have to admit that I&#8217;m something of a brushed metal whore.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Personally, I would like to see Camino focus more on new and cool features, kind of the way Opera brings a lot of unique features to the platforms it supports.  It seems unlikely that Camino will overcome Safari in terms of market share, and the features that initially brought it popularity &#8212; looking and feeling like a true Aqua app, having a very solid rendering engine, etc &#8212; are being duplicated or improved upon in Safari.  But if it offers some features that appeal to power/niche users &#8212; ones that Apple is less likely to explore because they don&#8217;t appeal to Joe Switcher &#8212; it&#8217;s likely to shore up a dedicated user base.</p>
