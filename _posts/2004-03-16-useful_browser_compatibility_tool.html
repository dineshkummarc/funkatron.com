<p><a href="http://www.zeit.ca/mozie/">Mozie</a> looks like a really useful tool to do side-by-side comparisons of IE and Gecko page renderings.  Windows only, unfortunately, but that&#8217;s to be expected.  It&#8217;s apparently built off of the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/control.htm">Mozilla ActiveX control</a>, which allows windows devs to embed Mozilla in their apps.  I wonder if it would be possible to just serve your page in Mozilla, embedded within IE.  I&#8217;m sure someone will try this shortly.</p>
