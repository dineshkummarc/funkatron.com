<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/06/wordpress-1513/">WordPress 1.5.1.3 Available</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;an important security issue was brought to our attention which required an update for our users. The problem is not yet public but you should update your blog as soon as possible to 1.5.1.3. If you are unable to do upgrade in the short-term you may protect yourself by deleting the xmlrpc.php file from your WordPress directory.</blockquote>

<p>Obviously if you use the XML-RPC interface (for posting from client apps and external services like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>), deleting the xmlrpc.php file is gonna be less than appealing.</p>
