<p>So about a month and a half ago I turned on the ancient water softener in our basement, because we had tons of calcium deposits on our dishes.  I believe I had run it for a while when we first moved in, but gave after a bit because I thought it wasn&#8217;t worth the trouble of handling the salt and such.<br /><br />This morning, a guy from the water dept came to my door.  He was checking to see if the meter was messed up, or if we had a leak.<br /><br />Uh-oh.<br /><br />I turned off the softener.  The meter stopped spinning.  That was &#8220;the leak.&#8221;  I guess it just never shut itself off, so it was constantly running water through itself.  I actually noticed it seemed to run a lot, but I&#8217;m a total novice with this shit, and assumed it was okay.<br /><br />So I called the utility office, because I was concerned about what the bill might be.  For good reason.<br /><br />Apparently, in the month of march, we had used 115,000 gallons of water.<br /><br />That will be <strong>$683</strong>, please.<br /><br />And of course, since I didn&#8217;t turn it off until the middle of march, I&#8217;d expect another half that much to get tacked on for April.  That should kick us up over $1000.<br /><br />Coulda bought a new softener for that, and done other improvements we need.<br /><br />They&#8217;ll spread it over 6 months, which is nice.  I <em>could</em> pay it all now, but it wouldn&#8217;t be easy.<br /><br />I know, I know, it&#8217;s just money, but&#8230; dammit.  I was hoping we were getting ahead.  And now something stupid I did cost us a whole chunk of change.<br /><br /><em>frown</em></p>

Something like that happened to us in the late 80&#8217;s or early 90&#8217;s, but only cost us about $125.</p>
