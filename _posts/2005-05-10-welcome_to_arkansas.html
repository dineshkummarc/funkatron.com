<blockquote>Calvin Milo Alvarez, 30, of 2974 N. Gregg Ave., Fayetteville, was arrested Monday on a charge of distribution/possessing/viewing sexually explicit matter involving a child.<br /><br />Last Wednesday, Officer Chris Denton and Officer Scott Carlton responded to a call from residents of Appleby Apartments at 2974 N. Gregg Ave., according to the police report, and when they arrived, they found Alvarez dressed in a baby diaper and another male subject verbally arguing. The suspect’s computer reportedly was at the bottom of the stairs and he was bleeding from the mouth. Both men had been drinking, police said, and the second man told officers that he had walked in on the suspect, a roommate, and found him viewing child pornography on his computer, according to the police report.<br /><br />Officers reportedly seized the computer, believing it to contain child pornography and submitted it to evidence.<br /><br />On Thursday, Alvarez reportedly came to the police department to talk to Det. Mike Parks about the computer and its contents. During the interview, Parks reported, Alvarez admitted to possessing approximately 500 sexually explicit images of children.<br /><br />On Friday, a search warrant was obtained authorizing the search of the seized computer by the initial responding officers, the police reported stated, and an image of the suspect’s hard drive was obtained by a trained computer forensic examiner using special software and hardware that prevent alteration of the hard drive contents.<br /><br />A preliminary exam of the contents of the drive reportedly revealed approximately 9,000 images depicting children from ages 1 to 12 years old. Alvarez fled police on foot when they attempted to arrest him at his place of employment. He was later located at his mother’s home and was taken into custody, Parks said, adding that the identities of the children depicted are unknown and the investigation is continuing. Pair arrested on drug charge.</blockquote>
