<p>It&#8217;s taken a while to get out, but LameBrain 0.5.1 is finally available.  Goodies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>New feature: &#8220;Expert&#8221; tab allowing manual entry of command-line parameters</li>
<li>New feature: Customizable naming schemes for ripped files</li>
<li>New feature: Preference to delete source files after encoding finishes</li>
<li>Fix: Encoding Settings window control states are saved when window is closed</li>
<li>More progress on docs (still not finished)</li>
<li>Some other stuff I forgot</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve decided to start asking for donations for LameBrain.  LB is still <b>free</b>, but a little bit of coin will help defray development costs (stuff like Coke and <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com">Jimmy John&#8217;s</a>).  If you&#8217;d like to donate, just click the button on the maIn page of my blog.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just posted my comments on the MacUpdate site, where I gave LB 5 stars in every category possible. You&#8217;ve got a great app started here, and I hope it continues. I downloaded it on a whim about two weeks ago, but I&#8217;ve since begun using it for all my CD ripping.</p>

<p>One concern: LB used to come with a handy help file, I think, which defined the encoding options and LAME terms (e.g., What is LAME? What does joint mean? What is VBR?), and I found it useful. Will that be included in future releases?</p>

<h2>Stable, feature-rich, versatile, customizable &#8212; all very nice. Though I&#8217;m not a big fan of Skeletor, I must admit.</h2>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>LAMEBrain is a nice app. Well done.</p>

<p>Thought I would mention one quick bug, that should be easy to fix:</p>

<p>While LAMEBrain properly prefaces encoded filenames with a 0 in front of the track number(to make them sort correctly in the finder), it forgets to add the 0 in front of the .m3u file listing, making all the playlists incorrect. Easy to fix on my end, as well, but I thought you would want to know.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the catch Matthew.  I&#8217;ll try to fix it for 0.5.2.</p>
