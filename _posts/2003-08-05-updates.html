<p>Nah, I&#8217;m not dead &#8212; just busy.  We finally moved, and we&#8217;re still kinda trying to get settled.  We also had to buy <a href="http://finklers.com/ed/pics/jetta/">a new car</a>, which wasn&#8217;t bad since the car is BAD-AZZ, but not great since it meant we had a car payment again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As for development, LameBrain has lately taken a backseat to work on Funkatron Viewer, a simple image viewer intended to sorta emulate the feel of <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</a>, my favorite Win32 image viewer.  FV should be ready for release sometime in the next couple weeeks.  I do still intend to work on LB, and I have some exciting ideas for it, but I just don&#8217;t have the time right now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This site may be changing in the next few weeks.  I want to get more consulting business going, so it&#8217;s likely that Funkatron.com will be the address for that.  This blog and the apps will still be available, although you might have to click once or twice to find them.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is the right email target, but I&#8217;d like to use LameBrain 0.6.1 on the cover CD of Macworld Plus. Would this be OK? To learn more of Macworld Plus go to http://www.macworld.co.uk/macworldplus</p>
