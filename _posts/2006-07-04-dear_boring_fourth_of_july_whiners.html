<p>Grow up and stop being such a goddamn hater.  Fireworks are fun if you allow yourself to enjoy them, as are cookouts and having fun with friends and family.  Yes, of course some people will behave like asses &#8212; this is not a new thing, this is not only in your neighborhood, this is not because of George Bush, this is not exclusive to the United States.  If you have better things to be doing, go do them and don&#8217;t blog about how much you hate what others enjoy.</p>
