<p>Running <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio">Zend Studio</a> 5.2 in WinXP within <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels Desktop</a> on my 20&#8221; iMac Core Duo (1.5GB RAM).&#xA0; It runs pretty nicely, and since it&#8217;s a crapshoot getting the <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio">ZDE</a> installed on an Intel Mac, quite handy.</p>

<p>Parallels Desktop has gotten better since the last time I tried it.&#xA0; Seems more stable, and has added some handy features, like automatically adding a network share on your OS X host to allow you to map it as a drive in Windows.&#xA0; CD/DVD handling seems to work better now too, although I have only tried reading, not writing disks.<br /> </p>

<p>I really highly recommend an Intel Mac for anyone who&#8217;s interested in running OS X and Windows (even for midlevel gaming).&#xA0; I&#8217;ve been extremely happy with this purchase.&#xA0; If <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a> and/or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> come out with host apps for their virtualization systems, it&#8217;s gonna be utterly killer.<br /> </p>
