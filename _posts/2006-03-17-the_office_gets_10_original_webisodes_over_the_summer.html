<p>Damn this rules:<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>PRESS RELEASE &#8212; NBC&#8217;s hit comedy &#8220;The Office&#8221; (Thursdays, 9:30 - 10:00pm ET) goes digital with ten, original stand-alone webisodes premiering on NBC.com this summer. The serialized arc will star the accounting staff of the Dunder Mifflin paper company in an edge-of-your-ergonomically-designed-seat whodunit.<br /><br />When the Dunder Mifflin accountants &#8212; Angela (Angela Kinsey), Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar (Oscar Nunez) &#8212; discover that $3000 is missing from the Scranton office, no one is above suspicion, as the crack team of numbers crunchers tries to solve the mystery before turning on each other. Rainn Wilson, Melora Hardin, Phyllis Smith, Kate Flannigan, Leslie David Baker and David Denman also star. </blockquote>
