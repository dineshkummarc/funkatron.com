All of this came about when the duo realized that their attempts at an interview needed to be taken from a different angle. They began to investigate his filmmaking process, which of course, brought up the questions of his practices. I think Melnyk really describes the man best: &#8216;We&#8217;re a bit disappointed and disillusioned with Michael, but we are still very grateful to him for putting documentaries out there in a major way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
