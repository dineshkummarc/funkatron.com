<p><a href='http://funkatron.com/apps/lamebrain/LameBrain_Source_Code.zip' rel='attachment wp-att-611' title='LameBrain Source Code'><img src='http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/lamebrain-icon.png' alt='LameBrain icon' align="right" /></a>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/lamebrain/LameBrain_Source_Code.zip">the source code for LameBrain</a>, my LAME-based mp3 encoder for OS X.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been (ugh) nearly 4 years since LameBrain was updated.  It was an enjoyable project, but I simply lost interest: I didn&#8217;t use the program myself, moving to encoding most of my music with the iTunes AAC encoder.  I also had pushed the app feature wise as far as I ever intended.</p>

<p>Still, people continue to search for and download LameBrain every day from this site.  It evidently scratches an itch for some people, and that&#8217;s a source of pride for me.  So I&#8217;d hate to just sit on the program and not give others an opportunity to run with it.  I think there are some valuable bits in the horribly structured code I wrote back then, and maybe someone with more drive than me will build on what&#8217;s here.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has used LameBrain, and especially to the folks who donated money for its development.  It&#8217;s been a lot of fun.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would <em>love</em> to, but RB5.5, which is the last version I have that will work with all the plugins it requires, will <em>not</em> compile universal binaries.</p>

<p>If enough people demonstrated interest, I might consider working to remove the reliance on the MBS plugin, which is the major thing holding it back.</p>
