<blockquote>REAL Software CEO and president Geoff Perlman explained that REALbasic itself is cross-platform by design, which helps REALbasic developers to make the transition. &lsquo;Most applications will require nothing but a simple re-compile, with no code changes at all,&rsquo; said Perlman in a statement.</blockquote>

<p>This really isn&#8217;t a big surprise, seeing as RB can already compile Windows and Linux apps for x86.  I do wonder if <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/">RealSoftware</a> had any heads-up about the PPC->x86 transition, and whether this has anything to do with the delay of <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/realbasic2005/">RealBasic 2005</a> (which was supposed to be released by the end of May).  I have a new project in mind for RB, but I&#8217;ve been waiting for the imminent release of the new version before starting.</p>
