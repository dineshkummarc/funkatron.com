<blockquote>Ford said the idea was to represent what an average system administrator may do, as opposed to a &#8220;wizard&#8221; who could take extra steps to provide plenty of security on a Linux setup, for instance.</blockquote>

<p>Actually, this doesn&#8217;t entirely surpise me.  The key here is &#8220;average system administrator,&#8221; and believe me, what passes for a sysadmin these days is often pretty scary.  Windows&#8217; ease of use certainly is going to benefit folks like this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be very curious to see a similar comparison between OS X Server and the other two, as (to simplify matters way too much) OS X would seem bring the best of both worlds.</p>
