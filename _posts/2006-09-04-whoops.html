<p>Yeah, so I was a bit distracted this weekend (which was a 4-day for me because I took Friday off, although I was doing contracting work much of that day) because we bought a new TV and stand, and I just realized that I am giving a seminar on Wednesday.  This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if I knew what I was gonna talk about.  I think I&#8217;m going to need to just tweak something I have done before, because there&#8217;s no way I can come up with a new one in a day and a half.  Plus, I think I was supposed to turn in a title and abstract like 4 days ago.</p>
