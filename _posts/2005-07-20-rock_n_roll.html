<p>This is the second time this has happened.<br /><br />Today Griffin and I were driving to day care, and I was playing Icon of Coil.  This isn&#8217;t surprising, since shit, I listen to them about 30% of the time.  Anyway, Griffin decided he was having none of this, and demanded &#8220;rocknroll!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You don&#8217;t like this, buddy?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No!  Rocknroll!&#8221;<br /><br />So I put on Motorhead.<br /><br />Sorry Andy.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/107398.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/107398.html</a></em></p>
