A few items that hook into OS X-specific technologies aren&#8217;t ported, but shell commands are handled by your Cygwin install on Windows.  It works surprisingly well.</p>

<p><strong>e</strong> also has what seems to be a unique feature &#8212; <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/blog/2006/making-undo-usable">an integrated revision control system</a> that enables collaborative editing and a very powerful, advanced &#8220;undo&#8221; functionality.  I haven&#8217;t delved into this much, but it looks like a really cool feature.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how much longer I&#8217;ll be using a Windows box as a primary development machine, but for as long as I do, <strong>e</strong> <em>will</em> be my main text editor.  Even in its current beta, semi-buggy state, it&#8217;s head and shoulders above anything else I&#8217;ve tried.</p>
