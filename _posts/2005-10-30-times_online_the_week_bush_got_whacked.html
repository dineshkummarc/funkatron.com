<blockquote>For a moment it was as if the prosecutor rather than the president was standing up for the integrity of the nation and behaving as a patriot.<br /><br />Moreover, Fitzgerald made it clear that his inquiry was not yet over. His indictment reveals that it was not Libby — but a mysterious &#8220;Official A&#8221; — who gave Plame’s name to Novak. Libby, it transpired, had passed it to three other journalists, including Miller who had failed to make use of the information in print.<br /><br />Official A is widely believed to be Karl Rove, the president’s chief political adviser and a man widely known as &#8220;Bush’s brain&#8221;. Experts now believe that Fitzgerald, having charged Libby, could push him to expose Rove’s role in exchange for a more lenient sentence. That, say some, could open the door to Cheney being charged.<br /><br />If Libby comes to trial, Cheney is bound to have to take the stand as a witness. At the very least he will have to answer embarrassing questions about why he let Libby claim throughout the 22- month inquiry that he learnt of Plame’s identity only through reporters when Cheney himself had told Libby that Plame worked for the CIA.</blockquote>
