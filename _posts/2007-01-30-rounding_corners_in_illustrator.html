<p>Adobe Illustrator is a lovely vector drawing tool, but one of the places where it&#8217;s mucho lame is in dealing with rounded corners on objects.&nbsp; There actually is a Rounded Corner tool in Illustrator CS2 (maybe earlier too, I can&#8217;t recall), but you can&#8217;t edit the corner roundness after you&#8217;ve drawn the object. <i><b>LAME</b>.</i></p>

<p>To apply rounded corners to an existing object, there is a filter called &#8220;Rounded Corners,&#8221; but this will only round <i>all</i> of the object corners.&nbsp; Sometimes this is fine, but yesterday I wanted to be all Web2.0 and only round 1 corner of an object. I could have made a rectangle with standard corners and do some magic with object mashing, but that&#8217;s fruity.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I came across <a href="http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html">a handy little collection of scripts for Illustrator CS and CS2</a>.&nbsp; One of the scripts is called &#8220;<a href="http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html#roundany">Round Any Corner</a>,&#8221; and it lets you select a single corner point and apply rounding only to that corner.&nbsp; Totally awesome timesaver for when you&#8217;re trying to make your <a href="http://www.andrewwooldridge.com/myapps/webtwopointoh.html">hipster Internet startup</a> web site.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you (and the guy who wrote that script)! Why Illustrator still doesn&#8217;t have a way to do this naturally is a mystery. This just saves me hours of extra work when trying to round off select arbitrary angled corners.</p>
