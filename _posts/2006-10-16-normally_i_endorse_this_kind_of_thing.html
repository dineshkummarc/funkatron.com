<blockquote>Emily Davis, 17, of Bowling Green told investigators she took her bra off while her friend was driving on Interstate 75.<br /><br />A vehicle following the car crashed and rolled several times after swerving to avoid the bra. The driver, James Campbell, 37, broke a vertebra in his neck, and his passenger, Jeff Long, 40, broke several ribs.</blockquote>
