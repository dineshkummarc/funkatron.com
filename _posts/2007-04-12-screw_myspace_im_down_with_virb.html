<p>Since last post was a good Myspace trashing, I thought I&#8217;d mention a social network site I&#8217;ve been digging: <a href="http://virb.com">Virb</a>. Here&#8217;s why I like it:</p>

<ul>

    <li>It&#8217;s pretty and clean. You&#8217;re not overwhelmed with information. It&#8217;s *pleasant* to look at Virb.</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s easy to make basic changes to your profile, and you have full CSS control if you want or need it. I haven&#8217;t come across a site that handled &#8220;themeing&#8221; as well as Virb.</li>

    <li>Virb clearly thought about how to organize your stuff, and it does a good job of letting you do so in an easy and logical manner</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s easy to add new modules to your profile that can include more advanced html and embedded media. Where your media can come from is whitelisted, which means <strong>better security</strong>; there&#8217;s much less chance of having your profile hijacked just by viewing someone else&#8217;s page</li>
    <li>Embedding Flickr photos is SO easy. Since I use Flickr for everything, it&#8217;s totally awesome.</li>

    <li>If you&#8217;re into music, Virb does a good job of letting you check out tunes, add bands, keep track of their shows, and the like *without* all the shittiness of Myspace</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s not flooded with ads and doesn&#8217;t make you log-in and &#8216;start over&#8217; unnecessarily</li>

</ul>

<p>So what don&#8217;t I like about Virb so much?</p>

<ul>
    <li>I really really wish I could import data into my profile via RSS. I already have 3 blogs (counting my work blog) &#8212; I have no interest in maintaining another. If I could just have my blog entries imported into my Virb blog, it&#8217;d be perfect. (<strong>update:</strong> Virb has blog importing via RSS <a href="http://virb.com/is/new_features">listed as &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221;</a>)</li>

    <li>Worse, no RSS feeds for my Virb blog! This is a big missing piece, and I&#8217;m really surprised they don&#8217;t have this yet. This bad boy should be filled with subscribable (is that a word?) data so you can track your friends, your bands&#8217; shows, and the like.</li>
</ul>

<p>So consider this an invitation:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a href="http://virb.com/funkatron">My personal Virb profile</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://virb.com/cultofjester">Cult of Jester&#8217;s Virb profile</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I’m trying Virb to see if it is everything people say it is.</p>

<p>I loaded my pictures which wasn’t oo hard. I added my first blog entry - simple and Now I’m moving into more detailed stuff. I hope it beats MySpace - sick of webcam girl and It’s ok to look ads.</p>
