<blockquote><p><a href="http://netevil.org/node.php?nid=303">PHP Podcast - Evil, as in Dr.</a>: I&#8217;ve just finished chatting with Marcus Whitney for part of the next installment of his <a href="http://www.pro-php.com/">Pro PHP Podcast show</a>. It&#8217;s my first recorded conversation/interview for public consumption. I&#8217;m kinda nervous and hope that I didn&#8217;t ramble on too much. But that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about; getting more personality out of people than you would with just text alone.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really dug the first <a href="http://www.pro-php.com/">Pro PHP podcast</a>, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the first interview.</p>
