Video: FEMA&#8217;s embarassing e-mails</a><br /><br />That should play nicely even on OS X (at least in Firefox), but you can read more about it at:<br /><br />- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/national/22text-fema.html">FEMA E-Mails - NYT</a> - includes PDFs of the e-mails<br /><br />- <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/17/AR2005101701230.html?nav=rss_email/components">Messages Depict Disarray in Federal Katrina Response (Wash.

Kathleen Babineaux Blanco (D) requested 40,000 U.S. troops on Aug. 31.</blockquote>
