<blockquote>If it hasn&#8217;t yet aired in your community, see Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard&#8217;s breakdown on Meet the Press, at approximately the halfway point in the broadcast. His tearful advice to the feds: &#8220;Shut up and send somebody&#8230;We keep hearing, &#8216;The cavalry&#8217;s coming, the cavalry&#8217;s coming. I hear their hooves, but they&#8217;re still not here.&#8221;</blockquote>
