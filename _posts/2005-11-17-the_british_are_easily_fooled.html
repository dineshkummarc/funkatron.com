<p>In what is probably the greatest thing ever since <em>My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancee</em>, some assholes in England are gonna trick 9 participants in a reality show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2005-11-17/tv/6">into believing they&#8217;re going into space</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The newspaper said that the nine contestants are about to undergo training in what they believe is Russia after actually circling around Britain for hours. Their training center, a onetime British military base now populated by Russian-speaking actors, has been given a makeover to resemble Star City, the cosmonaut training center in Russia, and their space shuttle is actually the movie spaceship built for the Clint Eastwood movie Space Cowboys, the Times said.</blockquote>
