<p>As you may know, I really really like Pro Football.  So today was exciting, because we had the games which determined who would play in next week&#8217;s SuperBowl.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where I can appreciate a good game and a good team without liking or disliking either of the teams involved.  Nevertheless, I do tend to favor one team over the other to some extent, especially when the stakes are as high as they were this week.  Unfortunately, both my preferred teams (the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=ten">Tennessee Titans</a> and the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=phi">Philadelphia Eagles</a>) lost.</p>

<p>Still, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m upset that the teams that won (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=oak">the Raiders</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=tam">the Buccaneers</a>) will be in the SuperBowl.  Gruden <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs02/columnist/2003/0119/1495409.html">leaving the Raiders and then meeting them the next year in the SuperBowl</a> is just too interesting.  This will be a good game, although if I were a betting man, I&#8217;d put my money on silver and black &#8212; they just seem like a more complete team.</p>
