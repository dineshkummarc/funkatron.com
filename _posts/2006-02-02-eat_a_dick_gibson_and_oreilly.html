<blockquote>Contradicting predictions by commentators that Brokeback Mountain would not attract ticket buyers in red-state strongholds like Montana, the film has actually performed strongly in many of those areas, distributor Focus Features has maintained. (Fox News commentator John Gibson remarked: &#8220;I think most people do not want to go into a darkened room with a tub of popcorn and munch away watching two guys get it on.&#8221; His colleague Bill O&#8217;Reilly has opined that the film has received critical praise because the media &#8220;want to mainstream homosexual conduct.&#8221; And he predicted, &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to go see the gay cowboys in Montana.&#8221;) However, the online magazine Salon today (Thursday) quoted the manager of the Wilma Theater in Missoula as saying that the film grossed $33,006 in its first four weekends there &#8212; &#8220;one of our best starts for a movie we&#8217;ve ever had.&#8221; In the conservative town of Kalispell, the film opened last Friday with $3,656. In the town of Whitefish, it took in $2,312 and beat out the three top national draws, including the No. 1 film, Big Momma&#8217;s House 2. Salon indicated that the film is also a hit in Great Falls, Bozeman, and Helena, where it also opened at No. 1.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />You know why?  Because it&#8217;s not about two flaming queers smoking meth, throwing on cowboy hats and teabagging each other.  It&#8217;s a sad, romantic story about unfinished love and fear and how it can haunt us to the day we die.  It&#8217;s not as if this movie makes out their relationship to be a super-awesome, healthy thing.  And maybe if folks like O&#8217;Reilly and Gibson weren&#8217;t such fucking assholes, they could but aside their homophobia and knee-jerk morality and see that, <em>even if they don&#8217;t think homosexuality is morally correct</em>.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/132480.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/132480.html</a></em></p>
