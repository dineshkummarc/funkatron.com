This will entail providing a coordinated, comprehensive federal response to any large-scale crisis and mounting a swift and effective recovery effort.&#8221;<br />That&#8217;s pretty clear, no? When the question is asked, &#8220;Who should&#8217;ve saved the people of New Orleans from starvation, thirst, rape, disease, and death?&#8221; </blockquote>
