<blockquote><a href="http://www.gojobby.com"><img src="http://www.gojobby.com/Jobby/img/logo_small.gif" align="Right"></a>I think Web 2.0 needs a little cultural diversity training.  A new job tracking website called, well, Jobby has just launched in beta.<br /><br />I mean, seriously people, at least give your name <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jobby">a spin through Urban Dictionary</a> and then <em>please</em> reconsider making the domain name gojobby.com.  You&#8217;re just not going to get that word-of-mouth marketing when you have to tell people that &#8220;I use Jobby&#8221;&#8230;.<br /><br />This stuff just writes itself:  <em>Build Your Own Jobby Posting Wizard to allow companies and recruiting firms to create their very own version of Jobby.</em></blockquote>
