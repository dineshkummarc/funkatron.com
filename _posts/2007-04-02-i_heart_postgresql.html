<p>I didn&#8217;t see this until today, since it went out the PostgreSQL newsletter which goes to my work account, but I thought it was pretty funny for an April Fool&#8217;s gag:</p>

<blockquote>
PostgreSQL 10.0, now called PREGRES, was released today.  Some new features include:
[&#8230;]
- A new table type: PgISAM.  Rather than using the cumbersome and complicated MVCC model, it simply acquires global database locks on read and write.  &#8220;It took ten years to create a benchmark that would make this one look good,&#8221; said Peter Eisentraut, in explanation for the delay. </blockquote>
