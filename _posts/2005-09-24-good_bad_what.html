		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s horseshit.  Finding certain aesthetics that happen to be present in people from a particular part of the globe is by no means racist.  That&#8217;s why you used the word &#8220;vaguely:&#8221; because you can&#8217;t back up your claim with a real argument.  If we take a look at the variety of definitions offered on Answers.com for racism, we find:</p>

<p>&#8220;The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial worldview-the ideology that humans are divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called “races,” that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural behavioral features, and that some “races” are innately superior to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Racism is a belief in the moral or biological superiority of one race or ethnic group over another or others.&#8221;</p>

<p>That I often find petite asian women attractive has nothing to do with believing that 1) the concept of race actually exists, 2) physical attributes correspond to character attributes, or 3) that some &#8220;races&#8221; are superior to others.</p>

<p>As for being a cliche, I&#8217;m unconcerned whether some of my preferences are shared by others.  The fact that you&#8217;d summarize a person so quickly based on so little information is intellectually lazy, ignorant, and sad.</p>
