<p><a href="http://digg.com/security/Spafford_On_the_Use_of_Lie_Detectors_by_the_US_Gov_t">Interesting article</a> in zee work blog:</p>

<blockquote>Noted security and cybercrime expert Eugene Spafford discusses the challenges and complexities in the use of lie detectors by the US Government to screen for security clearances.  &#8220;Lie detectors have a non-zero rate of error. As with many real-world systems, these errors manifest as Type I errors (alpha error, false positive) and Type II errors (beta error, false negative), and instances of &#8216;can&#8217;t tell.&#8217; It&#8217;s important to understand the distinction because the errors and ambiguities in any system may not be equally likely, and the consequences may be very different.&#8221;</blockquote>
