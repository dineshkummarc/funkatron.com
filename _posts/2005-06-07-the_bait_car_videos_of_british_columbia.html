<p>This is just too delightful.</p>

<blockquote>Of course, videos like this make the prospect of encroaching governmental entrapment so worth the gamble! In a Burnaby, British Columbia video called Oh No (streaming wmv file), a Canadian car thief is grooving to The Verve&#8217;s Bittersweet Symphony when he realizes that he&#8217;s the target of a dragnet. As he laments his predicament, he whines &#8220;oh fuck&#8221; and &#8220;oh no&#8221; to the music. Only when the police disable his car by remote control does he realize that he&#8217;s driving a bait car. By the end of the video, you actually feel bad for this guy - no mean feat.</blockquote>
