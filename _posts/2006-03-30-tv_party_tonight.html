<p>This episode of Futurama I recorded on Sunday for Griffin (he likes it, I like it, and it has a low level of wildly inappropriate humor for an animated show we both like), and they not only used Black Flag&#8217;s &#8220;TV Party&#8221; during a montage, but also sang a cast version of the song over the credits.  Goddamn that&#8217;s cool.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/141258.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/141258.html</a></em></p>
