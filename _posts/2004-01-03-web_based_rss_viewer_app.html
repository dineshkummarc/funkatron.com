<p>This is just a quick implementation of an idea I had, one mostly inspired by the RSS Reader Panel extension for Firebird.  I&#8217;ve only tested it in Firebird and Safari so far.</p>

<p>You should be able to just dump this in your web docs tree and fire it up in your browser.  Edit the feedurls.conf file to change the feeds.</p>
