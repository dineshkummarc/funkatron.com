<p>One of my favorite things on the whole entire Webernet is the <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/">Best of Craigslist</a>.  Here&#8217;s a good example:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sdo/62703081.html">http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sdo/6<wbr />2703081.html</a><br /><br /><em>&#8220;The fact that you walk around naked in your apartment is fine, I guess. It’s great that you feel so comfortable with yourself and your body. The time I forgot to close my blinds, and you saw me in my underwear was fairly embarrassing, but I got over it. I can also deal with the fact you like to get into the shower and hack up half of your lung each morning because you smoke like a chimney. It’s highly annoying, but I have an ex-husband. I’m great at blocking out certain disgusting bodily functions performed by a male.<br /><br />&#8220;Saturday night though, this went a little too far. I was attempting to have a nice, civilized dinner with some friends of mine, when I hear “Oh my GOD, Oh my GOD!!!&#8221; being screamed from my bedroom. It is my friend, and he is looking out of my window into your apartment.&#8221;</em><br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/92212.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/92212.html</a></em></p>
