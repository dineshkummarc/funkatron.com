<blockquote>Prior to the development of the first antibiotics in the 1930s, surgery carried a much greater risk of mortality from post-operative infection, and many diseases we take for granted today were life-threatening.  But massive over-prescription and the use of antibiotics as livestock growth supplements have lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains such as MRSA and VRSA that are a growing problem in hospitals around the world.</blockquote>
