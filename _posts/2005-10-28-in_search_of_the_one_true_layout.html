<p>I fucking love CSS, but certain kinds of layouts are annoyingly difficult to do &emdash; and very doable in table-based approaches.  Since we sure as hell don&#8217;t wanna go down that road anymore, <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/">position is everything</a> is GOLD, JERRY.</p>

<blockquote>Pure CSS-based layouts have come a long way but they still have shortcomings [2] that fail to address certain design goals without compromising the true separation of content and presentation.

In short, the problematic design goals are these:

<strong>Total Layout Flexibility</strong>

That is, the ability to order columns logically in the source while displaying them in any order desired. For any number of columns.

<strong>Equal Height Columns</strong>

Or more accurately, equal height columns without having to rely on faux columns.

<strong>Vertical placement of elements across grids/columns</strong>

Designers face the choice of relying on elements being a particular height, resorting to tables or simply not bothering.</blockquote>
