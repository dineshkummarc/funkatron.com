<p>Things are going better.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anything will be disappearing, but adjustments as to my focus(es) in life are happening and will continue.&nbsp; It&#8217;s exciting, but a little scary &#8212; fear of change and fear of regret are chronic problems for me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad that I have a strong support system of family and friends who help me and support me when I go a little crazy.</p>
