<p>I don&#8217;t generally agree with critics, but I like to use them for my purposes when I do.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2005-09-30#film4">Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDB.com</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In her review, Manohla Dargis in the New York Times compares Joss Whedon&#8217;s Serenity with George Lucas&#8217;s Star Wars: Episode III &#8212; Revenge of the Sith. Serenity comes out ahead. &#8220;Scene for scene,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;Serenity is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas&#8217;s recent screen entertainments. Mr. Whedon isn&#8217;t aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time.&#8221; Jan Stuart in Newsday makes a similar comparison, remarking: &#8220;George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Whedon. Serenity flies with sass and spirit, qualities that have been in palpably short supply in that Star Wars series since, well, Star Wars.&#8221; Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times also indicates that he had a good time watching the movie, writing: &#8220;Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire.&#8221; Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News notes that the movie appears to exist as a the final episode of Whedon&#8217;s canceled Firefly TV series and because the show&#8217;s fans &#8220;made the Firefly DVD set an unexpected best seller.&#8221; She adds: &#8220;Whedon&#8217;s sci-fi fantasies smartly parallel the serious issues we&#8217;re grappling with here on Earth, while his protagonists remain mordantly funny in the face of utter disaster. Like Star Trek before it, the outer-space setting is perfectly suited to a big budget&#8221; movie.</blockquote>
