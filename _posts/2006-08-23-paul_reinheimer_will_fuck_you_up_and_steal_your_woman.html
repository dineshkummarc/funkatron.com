<p><img hspace="5" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0764589547.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V60288727_.jpg" align="right" vspace="5"/>My friend Paul Reinheimer just had his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764589547/104-9758124-0409541?v=glance&amp;n=283155"><strong>Professional Web APIs with PHP</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>come out.&nbsp; The book covers using PHP to interface with a variety of web-based APIs, like those of eBay, Google, Paypal and Amazon. You can tell from Paul&#8217;s picture on the cover that he is not one to be trifled with. I strongly suggest that if you value your teeth, you pick up a copy <em>today</em>.</p>

<p>&#8230; for some reason I&#8217;m now reminded of an old Web game we used to play: http://www.edrugtrader.com/</p>
