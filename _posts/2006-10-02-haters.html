<p>It really bothers me when people talk about how the place I live is objectively bad.&nbsp; Not &#8220;I don&#8217;t like [place]&#8221;, but &#8220;[the place I live] is hell.&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard not to take that as a slap in my own face, because I live here by choice, and actually like it pretty well.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t like it here, but try to be a bit more respectful of the people who do, because not all of them are the slack-jawed yokels you seem to think permeate the population.</p>

<p>People say it about everything though. Lafayette sucks. Cincinnati sucks. Fucking Chicago sucks. Schaumburg REALLY sucks. You suck. I suck. Everything sucks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, but&#8230; I&#8217;ve always made it clear that the root of it is <em>my</em> issue, not the city&#8217;s.  And that I was joking about it smelling like barf and urine.  It&#8217;s only certain places.</p>
