<p>my head is still quite stuffed.<br /><br /><a name="cutid1"></a>I was doing a morning blowout of the gunk that had accumulated while I was asleep, and blasted out this ENORMOUS wad of brown snot.  I couldn&#8217;t believe that was in my head.  A bit disturbing, actually.<br /><br />today&#8217;s agenda calls for sleep and more sleep, with lots of juice and movies.  Yay for an HDTV &amp; HTPC in our bedroom.<br /><br />Days like this I am reminded of how lucky I am to have such a wonderful woman in my life.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/98396.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/98396.html</a></em></p>
