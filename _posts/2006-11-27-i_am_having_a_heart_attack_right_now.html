<p>Deadspin comes through again to let us know that Freddie &#8220;FredEx&#8221; Mitchell, washed-up shit-talking ex-receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, was recently <a href="http://www.deadspin.com/sports/nfl/in-case-you-were-wondering-what-freddie-mitchell-has-been-up-to-lately-217314.php">working as a substitute HS teacher in Mishawaka, IN</a>:<br /></p>

<blockquote>Supposedly the woman who was his kid&#8217;s mother lives in town, and he needed some extra money. He lasted all of one week, due to the fact that he was caught asking girls for their phone numbers.</blockquote>

<p>More on the awesomeness of FredEx:<br /></p>

<p>I went to HS about 4 miles from Mishawaka High School, was in a band with a couple guys from there, and lived in Mishawaka for about 4 years, which is why I&#8217;m flipping out about this.</p>
