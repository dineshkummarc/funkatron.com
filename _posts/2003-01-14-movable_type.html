<p>So in a lot of ways, Movable Type is pretty damn cool.  In other ways, it&#8217;s not so cool.  If your hosting doesn&#8217;t support 
suexec or some other kind of cgi wrapper, you have to chmod some directories to be world-writable, which is just ASKING for 
trouble if you&#8217;re on a shared host.  But holy hell is the admin system polished.  It makes me never even want to consider 
creating a system like this.</p>

<p>The comments don&#8217;t seem to be working.  I have no idea why not.  I&#8217;ll poke at it some when I get a chance, because I know 
you&#8217;re all chomping at the bit.</p>
