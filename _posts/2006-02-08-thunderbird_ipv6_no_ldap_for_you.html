<p>For a while now I&#8217;ve not been able to connect to the Purdue campus LDAP server from Thunderbird.  Today I got a bit more determined to figure out the issue, and discovered after about 5 hours that Thunderbird is just fucked in the following situation:</p>

<p>1) You are running WinXP
2) You have the Windows IPv6 stack installed
3) You try to connect to an LDAP server from the Thunderbird Address Book</p>

<p><a href="http://lair.moria.org/blog/entry/Work/Thunderbird_windowsXP_ipv6_and_LDAP_directories.txt" target="_blank">This guy</a> does a better job of explaining it than I ever could, and I only half understood what the fuck was going on anyway, but nevertheless, this is <i>beyond gay</i>.  All the other apps with LDAP server query functionality (like Ye Olde Windows Address Book) work fine.  I actually ended up installing Windump on my machine, and saw that while every other app connected to the LDAP server fine, Thunderbird&#8217;s packets went off on a fucking trip through Singapore and got sold into sex slavery.</p>

<p>Anyway, the workaround &#8212; until the Thunderbird guys fix <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228439" target="_blank">this 2+ year old bug</a> &#8212; is to go into the properties for your ethernet device and uninstall Microsoft Version 6 TCP/IP (or whatever they call it).  I guess I wasn&#8217;t using it anyway&#8230;</p>
