<blockquote>It&#8217;s icy, rocky and bigger than Pluto. And according to scientists who found it orbiting the sun, it&#8217;s the newest planet on our solar system&#8217;s block. The planet &#8212; the farthest-known object in the solar system &#8212; is currently 9 billion miles away from the sun, or about three times Pluto&#8217;s current distance from the sun.</blockquote>
