<p>I&#8217;m not gonna say that this is a particularly rational use of my time and funds.  I can&#8217;t say that I don&#8217;t logically see the reason why they had to take the boy&#8217;s dog.  But dammit, I fucking cried when I heard about this.  And now I can do something about it, maybe.<br /><br /><a href="http://katrinafoundpets.com/snowball_fund.htm">http://katrinafoundpets.com/snowball_fun<wbr />d.htm</a><br /><br />I just want this kid to be comforted and loved and taken care of.  I think this is a way I can do that.  If you do too, think about helping, or at least spreading this around.<br /><br />(And yeah, if it matters, I already have given a fair bit to other charities.  I don&#8217;t think this should be anyone&#8217;s top priority, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m choosing to do <em>in addition</em> to the other ways I&#8217;m trying to help).<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/117904.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/117904.html</a></em></p>
