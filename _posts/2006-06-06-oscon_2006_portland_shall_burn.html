<p>I will be attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a> in Portland, OR.  I&#8217;ll be flying in the evening of July 25th, and leaving the morning of July 29th.  I&#8217;m rather excited, because this time I will actually know some of the people attending/speaking at the event, and I think there will be a lot of opportunities to meet cool people, trade ideas, and talk to folks about <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a> and the <a href="http://phpsec.org">PHP Security Consortium</a>.Â  If you&#8217;re going to OSCON and want to meet up, let me know!</p>
