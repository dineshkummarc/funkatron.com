<blockquote>For an application like FeedLounge, the faster counting and smaller row size of PostgreSQL are compelling reasons to use it instead of MySQL with InnoDB tables. Add that it runs in 1/3 the time, using 1/3 the memory (making it essentially 10x faster for us) and that we can start taking advantage of other Postgres features, like data partitioning and partial indices in the near future, and you have the reason we decided to make the switch.</blockquote>
