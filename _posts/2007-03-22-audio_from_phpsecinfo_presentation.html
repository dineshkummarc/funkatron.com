<p>The video I recorded of my talk was fairly crappy, but I still intend to re-encode and upload it.  For now, here is <a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/Defending%20Web%20Applications%20With%20PHPSecInfo.mp3">the audio from the talk in mp3 format</a>.  You can still get <a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/defending-web%20applications-with-PHPSecInfo.pdf">the slides</a>, too.</p>
