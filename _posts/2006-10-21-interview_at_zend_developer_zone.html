<p>I decided to not be all self-deprecating as I usually am with things like this, and admit that I&#8217;m really happy and proud to say that I was interviewed by Cal Evans for the <a href="http://devzone.zend.com" title="">Zend Developer Zone</a>.</p>

<p />

<blockquote><strong>I guess the first question that comes to my mind is “Why did you build this?”</strong><br />
I built it because there was no good way to audit the security settings in your PHP.INI or your PHP environment. The average PHP user I feel is someone who can use an installer to install scripts on their server, get them running and do a little customization or hack up some code but they are not educated developers. These users have no easy way to check how secure their environment is. So I wrote PHPSecInfo to give these uses something easy to run and present the information in a format they are already familiar with.</blockquote>
