<p>I just LOVE it when I ask a very straightforward question on a mailing list, and get an &#8220;answer&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t address it at all.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote type="cite"><pre wrap="">Folks,
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>The php mysql api has a function "mysql_real_escape_string" that seems 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>to be able to thwart known SQL injection attacks -- at least the ones of 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>which I and other people I've discussed this with know.  I am curious to 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>know if pg_escape_string is as effective.  If not, what would need to be 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>modified to make it more effective?
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>(there is a possibility that I may be able to get a grad student to work 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span> on this at the center, so detailed responses would be appreciated.)
</pre></blockquote>

<pre wrap="">
The best advice is to use bind parameters rather than trying to build
SQL strings consisting partly of user input.
</pre>

<p><br /><br />Yes, that&#8217;s not bad advice, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re just trying to help, but could you ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION? Or, if you don&#8217;t know, DON&#8217;T ANSWER.<br /><br />rarr.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/102198.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/102198.html</a></em></p>
