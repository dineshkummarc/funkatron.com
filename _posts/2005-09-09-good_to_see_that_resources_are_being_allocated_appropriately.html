<blockquote>Portage Assistant Fire Chief Bill Lundy explains, &#8220;Our job was to advertise a phone number for FEMA. We were going to be given shirts and hats with a phone number on it, and be sent to shelters and we were going to pass out flyers.&#8221;<br /><br />Portage Assistant Fire Chief Joe Calhoun adds, &#8220;There were probably 700 firefighters sitting in this room getting this training and it dawned on them what we were going to be doing and then it got bad from there.&#8221;<br /><br />Lundy adds, &#8220;We&#8217;re trained in tactical medicine. We weren&#8217;t being used for that. We were being used to hand out flyers.&#8221;</blockquote>
