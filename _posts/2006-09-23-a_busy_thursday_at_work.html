Dermoid cysts are formed from the outer layers of embryonic skin cells. These cells are able to mature into teeth, bones, or hair, and these cysts are able to form anywhere the skin folds inwards to become another organ, such as in the ear or the vagina. The actual vagina is, of course, not able to bite, as the pubococcygeus muscles are not as strong as a human jaw.<br /><br /></font></font><font size="2"><font color="#16569e">(14:18:35) <font size="3"><strong>****</strong></font></font></font><font color="#16569e"><strong><font size="3">@gmail.com/Gaim:</font></strong></font><font size="3"> of course!</font></p>
