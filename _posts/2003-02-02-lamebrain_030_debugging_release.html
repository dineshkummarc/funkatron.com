<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a new release of LameBrain, intended for debugging feedback in anticipation of an &#8220;official&#8221; release.  This release adds batch encoding capabilities, and had some major rewrites of the code, so if you can take a few minutes and run the program through its paces, that would be super duper.  Just email any problems you find to <a href="mailto:coj@funkatron.com">coj@funkatron.com</a>.</p>
