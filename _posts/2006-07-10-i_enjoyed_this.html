<blockquote><p>It was truly one of the most astounding sports moments we can remember; like many Americans, we struggled to come up with an American sports equivalent, save for maybe Michael Jordan decking Byron Russell with two minutes left in Game 6. And even that wouldnâ€™t quite be the same.</p>  </blockquote>

<p>Marco Materazzi, the italian chap who was on the recieving end of Zidane&#8217;s beatdown, seems to have a history of douchebaggery.  Courtesy of <a href="http://mutoni.blogspot.com/2006/07/head-hits-man-in-chest.html">Mutoni&#8217;s Musings:</a></p>

It&#8217;s really too bad Zidane&#8217;s head didn&#8217;t do more damage.</p>  </blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="http://mutoni.blogspot.com/2006/07/head-hits-man-in-chest.html#c115254435056899274">a comment on the post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For what it&#8217;s worth, in Brazil the TV show Fant&#xE1;stico managed to capture what Materazzi said to Zidande before the headbutt. He called Zidane&#8217;s sister a prostitute twice, and then called Zidane some &#8220;very strong curse word&#8221; that couldn&#8217;t be repeated. Not that this explains it. The only person who understands why it happened is Zidane, and perhaps his psychologist.</p>  </blockquote>
