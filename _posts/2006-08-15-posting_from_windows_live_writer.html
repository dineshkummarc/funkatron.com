<p>So this new blogging tool from Microsoft, <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>, is pretty nice.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first Windows blogging client that works with LJ that didn&#8217;t make me want to stab myself in the eye.&nbsp; It also apparently works with Blogger,&nbsp;TypePad, WordPress, Movable Type, and other stuff that uses the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">Metaweblog API</a> or the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/mt-static/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">Movable Type API</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s embracement of the blogging community seems to have inspired much better UI design and use of open stadards.&nbsp; I&#8217;m very pleased.</p>

<p><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/0001z8z0" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="233" alt="Screenshot from Windows Live Writer" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/0001y1a1" width="240" border="0"></a> </p>

<p>The image insertion stuff is the <em>bomb</em>.&nbsp; It auto-generates a thumbnail with a neat little dropshadow, and you can apply watermark text and basic effects (sepia, b&amp;w, sharpen, et al), and do more operations.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> when you browse for a picture it only filters for .gif and .jpg, but you can change the file type to All Files and use PNGs.</p>
