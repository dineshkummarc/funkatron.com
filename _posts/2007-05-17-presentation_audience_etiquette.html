<p><strike>If you notice that the presenter has misspelled something in his or her slides, resist the temptation to point it out in the middle of the talk.  There&#8217;s nothing the presenter can do about it, and you just look like a douche trying to one-up your fifth-grade teacher.</strike></p>

<p />

<p>Update: I&#8217;m an idiot; they were friends of the presenter.  That&#8217;s what I get for assuming.</p>
