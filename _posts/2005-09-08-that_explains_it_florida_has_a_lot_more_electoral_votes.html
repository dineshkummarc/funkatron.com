<p><a href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1104/110304cm1.htm">www.GovExec.com - How FEMA delivered Florida for Bush (11/3/04)</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In 2004, George W. Bush and FEMA left little room for error. Not long after Hurricane Charley first made landfall on Aug. 13, Bush declared the state a federal disaster area to release federal relief funds. Less than two days after Charley ripped through southwestern Florida, he was on the ground touring hard-hit neighborhoods.<br /><br />Bush later made a handful of other Florida visits to review storm-related damage, but the story on the ground was not Bush&#8217;s hand-holding. Rather, it was FEMA&#8217;s performance.<br /><br />Charley hit on a Friday. With emergency supply trucks pre-positioned at depots for rapid, post-storm deployment, the agency was able to deliver seven truckloads of ice, water, cots, blankets, baby food and building supplies by Sunday. On Monday, hundreds of federal housing inspectors were on the ground, and FEMA already had opened its first one-stop disaster relief center.</blockquote>
