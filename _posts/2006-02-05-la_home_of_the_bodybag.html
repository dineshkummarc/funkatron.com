<p>This kicks ass:<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/hardware/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=178601965">LA Cops Fight Car Chases With GPS Devices</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will become the first law enforcement agency to outfit cars with a device that propels and sticks a Global Positioning System (GPS) onto a fleeing car.<br /><br />The department will mount the StarChase LLC device in the grill of some squad cars in the fall. &#8220;Officers in the car would control a green lazar light, similar to an aiming device that fixes on your target,&#8221; said LAPD Lieutenant Paul Vernon on Friday. &#8220;A small dart-like device is propelled from the officer&#8217;s car.&#8221;</blockquote>
