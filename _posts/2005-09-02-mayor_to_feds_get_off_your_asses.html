<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/09/02/nagin.transcript/">CNN.com :: Mayor to feds: &#8216;Get off your asses&#8217;</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote><em>Robinette asked the mayor about his conversation with President Bush:</em><br /><br />NAGIN: I told him we had an incredible crisis here and that his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice. And that I have been all around this city, and I am very frustrated because we are not able to marshal resources and we&#8217;re outmanned in just about every respect.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>WL: Do you believe that the president is seeing this, holding a news conference on it but can&#8217;t do anything until [Louisiana Gov.] Kathleen Blanco requested him to do it? And do you know whether or not she has made that request?<br /><br />NAGIN: I have no idea what they&#8217;re doing. But I will tell you this: You know, <strong>God is looking down on all this, and if they are not doing everything in their power to save people, they are going to pay the price</strong>. Because every day that we delay, people are dying and they&#8217;re dying by the hundreds, I&#8217;m willing to bet you. </blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>NAGIN: Well, did the tsunami victims request? Did it go through a formal process to request?<br /><br />You know, did the Iraqi people request that we go in there? Did they ask us to go in there? What is more important?<br /><br />And I&#8217;ll tell you, man, I&#8217;m probably going get in a whole bunch of trouble. I&#8217;m probably going to get in so much trouble it ain&#8217;t even funny. You probably won&#8217;t even want to deal with me after this interview is over.<br /><br />WWL: You and I will be in the funny place together.<br /><br />NAGIN: But we authorized $8 billion to go to Iraq lickety-quick. After 9/11, we gave the president unprecedented powers lickety-quick to take care of New York and other places. </blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Don&#8217;t tell me 40,000 people are coming here. They&#8217;re not here. It&#8217;s too doggone late. Now get off your asses and do something, and let&#8217;s fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country.</blockquote>
