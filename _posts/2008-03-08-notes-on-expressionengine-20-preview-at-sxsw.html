<h3><a href="http://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a> 2.0 will be powered by <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>CI gains abstracted querying</li>
<li>New CI libs like the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/forge.html">DBForge</a> built to support EE 2.0</li>
<li>EE Session library more powerful</li>
<li>EE Form gen and HTML gen</li>
<li><p><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> built into EE now</p></li>
<li><p>Basically, if EE needs something, CI gets new feature</p></li>
<li>Performance and simplicity still top priority</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes coming in EE 2.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>new CP theme designed from scratch</li>
<li>CP uses MVC pattern (CP has always been decoupled from EE&#8217;s frontend stuff)</li>
<li>CP has nice DHTML stuff driven by jquery - sortable tables, dynamic search results/filtering, ajax paging (retains sorting settings), pretty animations</li>
<li>New CP is very task-oriented: Create, Modify, View are primary sections, all available from opening</li>
<li>Top Bar: Content, Design, Add-Ons, Members, Admin, Tools</li>
<li>Nice little footer tabs called Accessories. Default are Learning EE stuff, EE News and site stats

<ul>
<li>Accessories can be added much like modules or plugins</li>
<li>Accessory creation doesn&#8217;t require PHP knowledge (but it helps to do more awesome stuff)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admin area no longer has Utilities

<ul>
<li>Content Admin and System Admin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Members have own section</li>
<li>Edit form shows nice dhtml tabs;

<ul>
<li>can create custom tabs from edit form</li>
<li>can add/edit custom fields from edit form</li>
<li>fields are resortable by dragging</li>
<li>full-page write mode for any field</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
