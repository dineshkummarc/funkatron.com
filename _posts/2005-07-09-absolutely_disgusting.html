<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1524852,00.html">Fox News slammed over &#8216;callous&#8217; line</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Another Fox News host, John Gibson, said before the blasts that the International Olympic Committee &#8220;missed a golden opportunity&#8221; by not awarding the 2012 games to France. &#8220;If they had picked France instead of London to hold the Olympics, it would have been the one time we could look forward to where we didn&#8217;t worry about terrorism. They&#8217;d blow up Paris, and who cares?&#8221; He added: &#8220;This is why I thought the Brits should let the French have the Olympics - let somebody else be worried about guys with backpack bombs for a while.&#8221;</blockquote>
