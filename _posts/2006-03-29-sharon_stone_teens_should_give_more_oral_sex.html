<p>Ya know, I loved Casino, but she is just batshit crazy.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In a bizarre explanation she tells this story, according to Contact Music UK:<br /><br />&#8220;I was in the store the other day and I watched a young girl trying on clothes, showing her abdomen.<br /><br />&#8220;Her mother was trying to talk to her about not being inappropriately luring. I said, &#8216;Gee that would look much nicer with a camisole under.&#8217; &#8220;Her mother walked away, and I said to the girl, &#8216;I&#8217;d like to give you a two-minute conversation about sex.&#8217; &#8220;Young people talk to me about what to do if they&#8217;re being pressed for sex? I tell them (what I believe): oral sex is a hundred times safer than vaginal or anal sex.<br /><br />&#8220;If you&#8217;re in a situation where you cannot get out of sex, offer a blow job. I&#8217;m not embarrassed to tell them.&#8221;</blockquote>
