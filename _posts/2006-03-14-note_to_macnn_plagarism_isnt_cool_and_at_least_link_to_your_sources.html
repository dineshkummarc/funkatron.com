<blockquote><strong>According to a post by narf2006, a user who is said to be very credible on the &#8220;WinXP on Mac&#8221; forums and has been diligently hacking away since the challenge started, the magic has officially happened and he has submitted his super secret process to the owners of the site to review.</strong> His proof offered up in the thread, however, is a Flickr set of photos (some better than others) of what appears to be Windows XP (will the real WinXP please stand up?) on what we assume to be an Intel iMac.<br /><br />Of course, immediate reaction tends to be &#8220;zomg Photochop lol!&#8221; And I won&#8217;t say that that wasn&#8217;t my initial reaction either. However, upon further inspection of the currently available evidence, there may be more to this rumor than mad chops. A post titled &#8220;Mission Accomplished - twice almost&#8221; on the Windows on Mac blog appears to indicate that narf2006&#8217;s processes are (almost) reproducible <strong>and there is even a thread on the forums now asking for testersâ€”three for MacBook Pros, three for iMacs, and three for Mac minis.</strong><br /><br /></blockquote>

<p>I know writing is hard, and C&amp;P can be tempting, but shit, at least reference where you saw the story first.&nbsp; It&#8217;s fucking common courtesy.<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> They added a credit, at least.&nbsp; No link tho.&nbsp; Lame.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/137325.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/137325.html</a></em></p>
