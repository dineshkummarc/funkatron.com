<p>I&#8217;m very, very excited to announce that <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> has <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-all/2007-May/000039.html">chosen to fund development</a> of what I&#8217;m calling &#8220;<strong>Inspekt</strong>&#8221; as part of their <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007">OWASP Spring of Code 2007</a>.  You can read my full proposal at the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007_Applications#EdFinkler_-_A_comprehensive_input_retrieval.2Ffiltering_system_for_PHP">OWASP SoC Application Page</a></p>

<p>The idea behind Inspekt is to provide a comprehensive input filtering and validation library for PHP.  Building upon Chris Shiflett&#8217;s original Zend_Filter_Input implementation, the primary <em>new</em> features will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide retrieval and filtering support for multidimensional arrays</li>
<li>Provide solutions for scoping issues (avoid the need for &#8220;global&#8221; keywords everywhere)</li>
<li>A variety of helper methods to reduce code verbosity</li>
<li>Block deprecated HTTP_*_VARS and other ways to grab input data without filtering</li>
<li>Auto-restrictions on input defined programatically or via configuration files</li>
<li>Compatible with PHP4 and PHP5</li>
<li>Self contained; not reliant on external libraries</li>
<li>Able to work with a wide variety of frameworks and app architectures; easily &#8220;pluggable&#8221; into any given web app</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m not sure where exactly the project will be hosted during development.  I want to at least have a browsable SVN repo, and some kind of mailing list.  I&#8217;m in the middle of php|tek 2007 right now, but I expect this weeked I can sort more of the details out.  I only have about two months to do this, so I need to get started!</p>
