<p>Oh hell yes:<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>After building my very first portable,-the Atari 2600 VCSp, back in 2000 (ever notice how awkward of a year that is to say?) I had a couple of &#8220;dream projects&#8221; to follow it up with. One was a Nintendo portable, which strangely took 4 years to manifest itself. The other was something I consider impossible at the time - an Atari 800 computer laptop. My ultimate dream portable!</blockquote>
