<p>Funkatron.com is hosted on <a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-958332-1485227">HostRocket</a>.  In general they&#8217;re pretty decent, but they&#8217;re got some problems with their cgi stuff.  As I&#8217;ve stated before, you really want to run Movable Type with a cgi wrapper, because if you don&#8217;t, you have to leave some directories world-writable.  HostRocket has a cgi wrapper, but there are some problems with it that cause MT to throw 500 Internal Server Errors from time to time (like when anyone tries to post a comment).  Can anyone recommend a better inexpensive host that supports MT better?</p>

<p>As for &#8220;inexpensive&#8221;, it&#8217;s all relative, and it depends on your needs. I&#8217;ve been with them for about 3 years and have been pleased. After reading up a bit more on their cgi wrapper stuff, here&#8217;s what they have to say about it:</p>

<p>Normally on a web server, CGI scripts run as the special unix user nobody in the group nogroup. That means that in order for the cgi to write or read files, they must be readable or writable to the world. This isn&#8217;t really that safe, since that means any other user on your server can read and write those files too!
On DreamHost servers, we have a special feature called suexec (which stands for &#8220;switch user execution&#8221;) turned on that makes your CGI scripts on your web site run as though they were run by your user and group!</p>
