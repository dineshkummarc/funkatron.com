<p>Our internal CRUD app framework uses DB_DataObject as its data access layer, and DB_DO is in turn built on top of the <a target="_blank" href="http://pear.php.net/package/DB/">Pear_DB</a> layer.  Pear_DB has <a target="_blank" href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-sequences.php">a special sequence system</a> that works great out of the box with MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT keys, but it needs a little fiddling to play nice with PostgreSQL&#8217;s SERIAL metatype.  Basically, if you don&#8217;t tweak the sequence stuff a bit, Pear_DB won&#8217;t be able to retrieve the next ID # in the sequence.  This is an ignorable problem for single-table situations, but can cause problems (including data loss) with many-to-many relationships and other more complex cases.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get the Pear_DB sequences to play nice with your PostgreSQL sequences is to redefine the <tt>sequenceKey()</tt> method in your DB_DataObject-extending class:</p>

<pre class="code">class Otacon_Contact extends DB_DataObject 
{
     [...]

    /* the code above is auto generated do not remove the tag below */
    ###END_AUTOCODE

    /* this is required to get PEAR DB sequences working properly */
    function sequenceKey() { return array('contact_id', false, 'contact_contact_id_seq'); }

     [...]
}

</pre>

<p>In the example above, <tt>contact_id</tt> is the primary_key of the table, and <tt>contact_contact_id_seq</tt> is the sequence that <tt>contact_id</tt> gets its next value from.  This makes the Pear_DB sequence stuff to query this sequence to get the next value for your primary key, and you should be golden.</p>
