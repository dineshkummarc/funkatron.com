<p>So something went wonky with my Powerbook, either in the power supply or the power plug in the machine itself, because it wouldn&#8217;t take any power when plugged-in.  So now I&#8217;ve got two empty batteries and a dead machine.  Hopefully it&#8217;s just a dead PS, which I can easily replace at work tomorrow.  If not, the machine will probably need to be sent back to Apple.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t realize just how valuable a portable computer is until you suddenly have it taken from you.  The flexibility of being able to go anywhere in our home and be online is super, super nice, especially with a 3 month old.  I also am peeved because without my Powerbook, I can&#8217;t do anything with OS X, which means LameBrain dev is stalled for the time being.</p>

<p>This will probably be a good exercise for me.</p>
