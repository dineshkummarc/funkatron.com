<p>The front-end that <i>kicks ass</i> and <i>takes names</i> is back:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Feature: preview an input track by CTRL+clicking/right-clicking on the input file and selecting &#8220;Play File.&#8221;  This works in the main window, batch encoder, and CD ripper.</li>
<li>New Feature: CD ripper generates a .m3u playlist file.  Turn this on or off in Preferences.</li>
<li>Bug fix: App should no longer crash if the CD ripper is opened while a network drive is mounted</li>
<li>Encoding profile for tracks in batch queue can be changed by highlighting one or more tracks and picking a new profile in the Encoding Profile popup menu.</li>
<li>Stats window opens automatically upon encoding start.  Turn this on or off in Preferences.</li>
<li>Log field in stats window now automatically scrolls to the end when a new entry is added</li>
<li>Most windows can now be closed with CMD+W</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m having a blast with LameBrain.  I see there is new version&#8212; 0.4.2, but when I download it opens as 0.4.1.  I&#8217;d like to utilize the new features of 0.4.2.  Help please?  Thanks!
Also, how do I encoded in alt-preset standard using the Ripper?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just tried downloading again, and it is indeed 0.4.2.  I have seen cases where my Chimera install will cache a downloaded file &#8212; perhaps it&#8217;s doing this here?  Maybe try another browser, or clearing your cache.</p>

<p>You can create new encoding profiles to use whatever settings you want.  Just set stuff up as you like in the main window, and go to the &#8220;Profiles&#8221; tab, type in a name, and click &#8220;Save Profile.&#8221;</p>
