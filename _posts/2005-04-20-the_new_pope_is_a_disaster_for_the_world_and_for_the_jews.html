<p>Obviously, this should be taken with the usual grain of salt &#8212; I don&#8217;t know enough about Ratzinger or Lerner to make a judgement.  <em>If</em> this is accurate, though, this is terribly disappointing, and would seem to only further distance the Roman Catholic Church from what I believe it <em>should</em> be doing: performing and promoting the <em>healing</em> work &#8212; physically, socially, and spiritually &#8212; that Christ taught.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/news_item.2005-04-19.4230239892">http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/news_<wbr />item.2005-04-19.4230239892</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>&#8220;While many of us agree with Ratzinger&#8217;s critique of moral relativism, he extends that critique in illegitimate and dangerous ways, equating secularism with moral relativism and suggesting that secularism is now repressing religion. Ratzinger also publicly critiques all those inside the Church who are tolerant enough to think that other religions may have equal validity as a path to God. This is a slippery slope toward anti-Semitism and a return to the chauvinistic and triumphalist views that led the Church, when it had the power to do so, to develop its infamous crusades and inquisitions. In 1997 Ratzinger called Buddhism an &#8220;autoerotic spirituality&#8221; that offers &#8220;transcendence without imposing concrete religious obligations.&#8221; Hindusim, he said, offers &#8220;false hope,&#8221; in that it guarantees &#8220;purification&#8221; based on a &#8220;morally cruel&#8221; concept of reincarnation resembling &#8220;a continuous circle of hell.&#8221; At the time, Cardinal Ratzinger predicted that Buddhism would replace Marxism as the Catholic church&#8217;s main enemy.<br /><br />&#8220;Ratzinger is being falsely described as a conservative, when in fact he, despite his publicly genteel manner, is a raging reactionary. Unlike many American conservatives who oppose gay sexual practices but not their legal rights, Ratzinger in 1992 argued against human rights for gays, stressing that their civil liberties could be &#8220;legitimately limited.&#8221;</blockquote>
