<p>We visited a house today that looked really, really cool.  Hardwood floors all over the place, 2 big bedrooms, 3 full baths, and a finished basement.  Within our price range (although close to the top), and being sold by the owner.  It&#8217;ll probably go fast, so we&#8217;ll need to make a decision fairly quickly about whether we want to pursue it or not.  It&#8217;s kinda scary to talk about laying out this kind of cash, but all the initial talks with mortgage folks have been really positive.  Apparenlty I have good credit still.  Who woulda thunkit!</p>
