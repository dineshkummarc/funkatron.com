<p>I haven&#8217;t played any videogames in forever.  That&#8217;s probably what&#8217;s been affected the most by having Griffin &#8212; I just don&#8217;t have much in the way of free time, and lately I&#8217;ve been focused on programming.  I&#8217;d like to game more, but normally I might have at most 10 minutes to play before I&#8217;d have to pause to change a diaper/roll him over/clean up vomit.  I feel kind of bad about buying the <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/hardware/networkadaptor/SCPH-10281.asp">PS2 network adapter</a>, because I only played <a href="http://www.sega.com/segasports/games/post_ssgame.jhtml?PRODID=10151">NFL2k3</a> online about 4 times.  Before that I got maybe 40% into <a href="http://www.sega.com/segasports/games/post_ssgame.jhtml?PRODID=10151">GTA:Vice City</a>, and about 70% through <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war3/">Warcraft III</a>, but I haven&#8217;t played any of them in about a month.  Hopefully the boy will be able to pick up a controller soon so we can do some bonding by trying to kill each other&#8217;s avatar.</p>
