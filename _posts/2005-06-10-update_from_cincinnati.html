<p>I&#8217;ve typed &#8220;Cincinnati&#8221; enough in the past few days that I can spell it correctly the first time, without the aid of automatic spellcheckers.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#8217;re here in Cin-town at <a href="http://phaedo.cx/">Clint</a> and <a href="http://www.ejacqui.com/">Jacqui</a>&#8217;s place.  It&#8217;s awesome to see them, and their cats and chinchilla. We just got back from eating at a cajun place downstairs from their apartment, and now we&#8217;re watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179074">American Pimp</a>.<br /><br />Good times. 8)<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104276.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104276.html</a></em></p>
