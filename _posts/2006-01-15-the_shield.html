<p>Dude, I <em>looked</em> at the schedule on Tivo Tuesday night, and I didn&#8217;t see the new episode of the Shield listed.  Now I look tonight on FX, and it&#8217;s repeating.  WTF?  Bastards.  Anyway, I&#8217;m season passed now, so it should be all good.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t mention before, but I got a 40hr Series 2 Tivo as a gift about a week ago, and I&#8217;m absolutely loving it.  I bought a USB-&gt;Ethernet adapter and have it hooked into my home network, so I can dump recordings off to PCs and stuff like that.  It&#8217;s basically fucking awesome, and works <em>so</em> well out of the box that I&#8217;m utterly in love.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/131179.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/131179.html</a></em></p>
