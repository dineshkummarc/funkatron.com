<blockquote>If you have a weblog or live journal, or you administer a website that has comment threads, stand up for yourself and your readers. The jerks are never going to like you, or praise you, or admit that you&#8217;re doing the right thing. And if you&#8217;re waiting for someone to give you permission to suppress and thereafter ignore malfeasants, you have it right now. If you want, I&#8217;ll make up a certificate. Go forth and civilize.</blockquote>
