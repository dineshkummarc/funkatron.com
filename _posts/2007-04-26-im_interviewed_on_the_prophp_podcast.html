<p>Paul Reinheimer interviewed me for <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com/main/index.php/main">the Pro::PHP Podcast</a> a couple weeks ago, and the podcast was just posted today. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing me ramble about secure PHP development, <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com/podcast/audio/20070426.mp3">download it</a> or <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com/podcast/rss/index.xml">subscribe to the feed</a>.</p>

<p />

<p>I say &#8220;uh&#8221; and &#8220;erm&#8221; a lot, which makes me sounds like a real pro, lemme tell ya.</p>
