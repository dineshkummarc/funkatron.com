<blockquote><a href="http://deadbrain.co.uk/news/article_2003_04_11_0720.php">Rumsfeld: There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a bit of looting</a> 11 Apr 2003 The United States Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has tonight dismissed reports of mass chaos and lawlessness in Iraq as &#8220;exaggerated&#8221;. &#8220;The so-called looting is not as bad as some reports have suggested,&#8221; he said at a Pentagon briefing. &#8220;Yes, people are ransacking hospitals, burning down buildings and fighting each other in the streets, but it&#8217;s not that bad. Stuff happens.&#8221;</blockquote>
