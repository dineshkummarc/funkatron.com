<p>My major outside-of-work project is a rewrite of DBForms, called <a href="http://otacon.sourceforge.net">DBForms2</a>.  I just finished getting the new version to a state where it actually kinda functions: you can add, edit, and delete database entries in your application.  It&#8217;s still really, really early, but it <b>does</b> work, and that&#8217;s gratifying.</p>
