<p>So I bought the php|arch PHP4 certification study guide a couple months before <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/" title="OSCON 2006">OSCON 2006</a>.  It took a while to get to my house (like a few weeks) and by that time, Zend was all talking up the PHP5 cert program.  Now <a href="http://benramsey.com/" title="Ben Ramsey">Ben Ramsey</a>, the evil bastard he is, has <a href="http://benramsey.com/archives/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-published/#comments" title="I hate you Ben">the PHP5 cert guide</a> he wrote with Davey Shafik out from php|arch.  I hate you, Ben.  Can&#8217;t I get a rebate or something on the new book?</p>
