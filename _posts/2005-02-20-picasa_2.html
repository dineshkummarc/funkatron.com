<p>Anyone else played with Picasa 2?  I&#8217;m really impressed.  It&#8217;s fast as hell (comparing my gf&#8217;s 2.5Ghz Celeron laptop w/192MB RAM to my iBook 1Ghz G4 with 768MB RAM), very easy to work with, seems to have more editing features than iPhoto&#8230; Hell, the program even LOOKS great &#8212; better than the brushed metal of iPhoto, fer sure.</p>

<p>I dunno that I will be using it much, since any photo cataloging I do is on OS X, but I certainly know what I&#8217;ll be recommending to others who run Windows exclusively.</p>
