<p>is <a href="http://www.tv.com/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia/show/33928/summary.html?q=its%20always%20sunny%20in%20philadelphia&amp;tag=search_results;title;0">the best comedy on TV right now</a>.  It&#8217;s right up there with Arrested Development, The Office, and Reno 911.  It&#8217;s on FX, and you should fucking watch it.  How can you beat a show with episode titles like this?<br /><br />- Charlie Wants An Abortion<br />- The Gang Finds a Dead Guy<br />- Charlie Got Molested<br /><br />It&#8217;s so wonderful.</p>
