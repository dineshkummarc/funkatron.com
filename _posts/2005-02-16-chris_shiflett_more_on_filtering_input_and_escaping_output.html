<p>I found this post quite educational, especially about what items in the various superglobals ($_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION) are tainted.  Basically, the gist is that $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE are always provided from the user, and therefore have to be considered tainted.  $_SESSION is stored by the server, and <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> be tainted if you did your job right (i.e., you didn&#8217;t store any tainted data in the session).  $_SERVER, though, is more complex, because some of the values in that array come from the web browser, despite the name of the array.  Check the comments for more detail.</p>
