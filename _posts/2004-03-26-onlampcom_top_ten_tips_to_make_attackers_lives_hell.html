<p>Good stuff here. Articles like this often lack practical implementation info, but this gives you some specifics to follow. One app it mentions that I wasn&#8217;t aware of is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/recommended/urlscan/default.asp">URLScan</a>, a free tool from MS to filter server requests.  Not that I&#8217;d ever use a MS Server for anything that the public could access, but if you <i>must</i>, this seems like a requirement for your IIS box.</p>
