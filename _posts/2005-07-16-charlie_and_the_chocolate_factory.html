<p>Great movie that touched my old nostalgic heart.  I loved the book as a child, and when I saw the Gene Wilder flick I thought it was kinda crappy (disliked how the change in title took away the emphasis on Charlie).  Really perfect material for Burton, and he did a great job bringing it to life.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/106955.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/106955.html</a></em></p>
