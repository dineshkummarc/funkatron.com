<p>And I cry and no one can hear <br />Inhale the blinded eyes that see <br />The chaos bring the pitiful to me <br />Even though I&#8217;m wide awake <br />I will in blackest night <br />And I wait for you <br />It&#8217;s cold in here, there&#8217;s no one left <br />And I wait for you <br />And nothing stops it happening <br />And I knew I&#8217;d cherish all my misery alone <br /><br />And I wait staring at the northern star <br />I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t lead me anywhere <br />He&#8217;s so cold he will ruin the world tonight <br />All the angels kneel into the northern lights <br />Kneel into the frozen lights <br /><br />And they paid, I cry and cry for you <br />Ghosts that haunt you with their sorrow <br />I cried &#8216;cause you were doomed <br />Praying to the wound that swallows all that&#8217;s cold and cruel <br />Can you see the trees, charity and gratitude? <br />They run to the pines <br />It&#8217;s black in here, blot out the sun and run to the pines <br />Our misery runs wild and free <br />And I knew the fire and the ashes of his grace <br /><br />And I wait staring at the northern star <br />I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t lead you very far <br />He&#8217;s so cold he will win the world tonight <br />All the angels kneel into the frozen lights <br />Feel their hearts, they&#8217;re cold and white <br /><br />And I want you <br />And blessed are the broken <br />And I beg you <br />No loneliness, no misery is worth you <br />Oh, tear his heart out <br />Cold as ice, it&#8217;s mine <br /><br />And I wait praying to the northern star <br />I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t lead you anywhere <br />He&#8217;s so cold raining on the world tonight <br />All the angels kneeling to the northern lights <br /><br />And I pray begging to the northern star <br />I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t lead you anywhere <br />He&#8217;s so cold he will rule the world tonight <br />All the angels kneeling to the northern lights <br />Kneeling to the frozen lights <br />Feel their hearts, they&#8217;re cold as ice</p>
