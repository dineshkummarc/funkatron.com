<p>So lots of people are pooping their pants over <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml">Yojimbo</a>, this new personal info organization app from BareBones.  I&#8217;ve started using it, and it is pretty cool, but I&#8217;ve run into a bit of an issue: it doesn&#8217;t like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> 2 files.  Try to drag one in, and you get no love.  I guess this is what they mean by the following:</p>

<blockquote>Store <i>almost</i> anything in Yojimbo&mdash;text, rich text, images, PDFs, even serial numbers and passwords</blockquote>

<p>(my emphasis)</p>

<p>Some may wonder why I&#8217;m still running OO v2 when I think <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> has had v3.5 out for about a hundred years.  That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m lazy, and I actually like v2 a bit better - it&#8217;s simpler, and I like the way it looks.  Probably it&#8217;s just inertia, though, and I&#8217;d like v3 better if I just used it.</p>
