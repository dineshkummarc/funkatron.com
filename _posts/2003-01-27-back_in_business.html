<p>It appears they problem was with my power supply, because as soon as I plugged-in the PS at work, I got my friendly green light and all was better.  This pleases me, because it means I don&#8217;t have to part with my precious Powerbook.  This also kinda miffs me, because the PS that failed was only like a month old &#8212; Apple sent us a replacement when the insulation split up by the plug.</p>
