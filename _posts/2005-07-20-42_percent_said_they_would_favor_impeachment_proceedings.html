<blockquote>The impeachment question was part of a Zogby International poll conducted early last week, and released on Thursday.<br /><br />It found that Bushâ€™s job approval ratings had slipped a point from the previous week, to 43 percent.<br /><br />But the jaw-dropper was that 42 percent said they would favor impeachment proceedings if it is found that the president misled the nation about his reasons for going to war with Iraq.<br /><br />Zogby noted: &#8220;While half (50%) of respondents do not hold this view, supporters of impeachment outweigh opponents in some parts of the country.</blockquote>
