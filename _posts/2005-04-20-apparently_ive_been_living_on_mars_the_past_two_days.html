<p>How the <strong>FUCK</strong> did I miss this story?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html">Adobe to acquire Macromedia</a><br /><br />Holy shit.  This worries me a lot, because Macromedia makes what I strongly believe is the best design tool for web graphics, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/">Fireworks</a>. Fireworks isn&#8217;t hugely popular, though, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Adobe kill it in favor of their <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop/ImageReady</a> combo.  IR is not bad, but isn&#8217;t at a vector-based tool like Fireworks, and that&#8217;s what makes Fireworks such a fucking great product.<br /><br />There is other crossover with Macromedia tools I like, but the main other one I use, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a>, is the best of breed in its category, and Adobe would be unlikely to trash it.  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/freehand/">Freehand</a> is actually a very underrated tool, but I usually end up using Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html">Illustrator</a>, if only because I know that stuff done in Illustrator will work fine at the printer (and also because Macromedia has basically abandoned it).<br /><br />Jesus.  This is BIG NEWS.  I am really anxious to hear any more about what&#8217;s planned.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/97156.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/97156.html</a></em></p>
