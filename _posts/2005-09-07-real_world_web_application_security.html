<p>I did a seminar today on web app security.  I&#8217;ve got the slides up over here:</p>

<p><a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~coj/">http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~coj/</a></p>

<p>The video should be back to us next week.  I&#8217;ll post it then.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time.  I had seen these seminars go 1:20 before, but I guess this year they have another class in the same room, so I only had 50 minutes <em>firm</em>.  I really had to rush through everything.  It was pretty broad, and a lot more depth could have been given.</p>
