<p>A review was requested.<br /><br />As I watched this film, I thought of the first couple Batman movies.  I never saw the Schumacher-directed ones, because it was utterly clear that they had more to do with Adam West than Frank Miller.  So fuck that.<br /><br />So I thought of the Burton-directed movies, and I came to the conclusion that Tim Burton sucks.  Fuck that Penguin shit.  Fuck Jack Nicholson.  Burton needs to stick to puppet films.<br /><br />This is the first Batmovie that actually <i>got it</i>.  It wasn&#8217;t the super best movie I ever saw in my life, but it was pretty fucking good.  Nolan and Goyer are gonna get a lot of money to make the next one.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104452.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104452.html</a></em></p>
