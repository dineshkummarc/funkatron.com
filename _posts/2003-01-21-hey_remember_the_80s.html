<p>I do, sorta.  Remember <a href="http://verbosity.wiw.org/issue4/images/adamc2.gif">Adam Curry</a>, the blonde lanky VJ dude?  He&#8217;s some kinda dot-com millionaire, and he has <a href="http://live.curry.com/">a blog</a>.  The blog is mildly interesting, but the best part is his collection of stories about <a href="http://mtv.curry.com/">his MTV days</a>:</p>

<p class="pullquote"> Apparently Ozzie was trying to communicate to us that his problem was larger than he could handle, and a few seconds later I looked up to see Ozzie standing spread eagle in the ilse, with a huge dark spot in his crotch area and a growing pool of urine at his feet.</p>

<p>Curry was a fairly forward-thinkin dude back in the day.  I remember <a href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/Cases/MTV_v_Curry/">the tussle he had with MTV over mtv.com</a> when I was in college.</p>
