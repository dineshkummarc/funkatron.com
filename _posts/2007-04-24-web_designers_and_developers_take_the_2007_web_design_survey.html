<p>I think this is a fabulous idea, and encourage anyone who does web work to participate.<br /><br /><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey"><img src="http://blog.funkatron.com/wp-content/i-took-the-2007-survey.gif" alt="A List Apart 2007 Web Design Survey" title="A List Apart 2007 Web Design Survey" /></a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Designers, developers, project managers. Writers and editors. Information architects and usability specialists. People who make websites have been at it for more than a dozen years, yet almost nothing is known, statistically, about our profession. Who are we? Where do we live? What are our titles, our skills, our educational backgrounds? Where and with whom do we work? What do we earn? What do we value?<br /><br />It&#8217;s time we learned the answers to these and other questions about web design. And nobody is better qualified than the readers of <cite>A List Apart</cite> to provide the answers. Participate in <a href="http://aneventapart.com/webdesignsurvey/survey.php?sid=2">our first annual survey</a> to increase knowledge of web design and boost respect for the profession. Selected participants, chosen by random drawing, will win one free ticket to <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a> event held in the continental U.S.; an Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">30GB video iPod</a>, an Event Apart jump drive, or a funky <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/store/"><cite>A List Apart</cite> T-shirt</a>.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
