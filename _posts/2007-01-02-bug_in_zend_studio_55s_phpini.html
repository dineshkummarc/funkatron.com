<p>In the php.ini file used by the PHP5 executable, the include path is hosed.&nbsp; If you installed in the default location and are running Windows, you&#8217;ll probably find the file at</p>

<pre>C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\php5\php.ini</pre>

<p>This line is from the original file:</p>

<pre>include_path = C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\ZendFramework\library;.</pre>

<p>You might notice that the value is not wrapped in quotes, which makes the ; character demark the beginning of a comment.  That eliminates your current working directory from the include path, which is a pretty major disaster when requiring external files into your script.  The solution is (taa-daa!) to wrap the value in quotes:</p>

<pre>include_path = "C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\ZendFramework\library;."</pre>

<p>What&#8217;s more annoying is that this bug was in the Beta of 5.5 as well, and apparently didn&#8217;t get fixed.</p>
