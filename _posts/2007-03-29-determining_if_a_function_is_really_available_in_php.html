<p>After pounding for a few hours, I think I finally got the UID and GID tests for <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> in an acceptable state.  Two things have made this hard:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can really only do this with an exec() call to the &#8220;id&#8221; UNIX command, or the posix_* functions, either of which are frequently disabled</li>
<li>There basically is not a foolproof way to programatically tell if a function is available or not in PHP</li>
</ol>

<h1>2 is the real rub, and quite annoying.  <code>is_callable()</code> will return TRUE even if a function has been disabled in php.ini with <code>disabled_functions</code> (which, in my mind, is contrary to what &#8220;is_callable&#8221; implies).  <code>function_exists()</code> will return FALSE if the function is disabled in php.ini, but will return TRUE if the function is being blocked by <code>safe_mode</code>.</h1>

<p>For now, the tests try <code>exec('id')</code> first, seeing if it passes <code>function_exists()</code> <i>and</i> <code>safe_mode</code> is disabled.  If it fails those, the <code>posix_*</code> functions are checked against <code>function_exists</code> (they aren&#8217;t affected by <code>safe_mode</code>.  If those fail as well, the test will be skipped.</p>
