<p>My friend <a href="http://www.phaedo.cx">Phaedo</a> has <a href="http://phaedo.cx/archives/2004/11/15/hostrocket-sucks-part-ii/trackback/">finally seen the light</a>, after I told him about a trillion times to ditch Hostrocket like a hooker with crabs.  He went with <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?coj">Dreamhost</a>, whom I&#8217;m using now, and love with all my heart.</p>

Dreamhost is a lot like modern macintoshes, they make everday stuff easy, and provide all the tools and documentation to encourage budding &#8220;powerusers&#8221;.  And they don&#8217;t do windows!  Dreamhost, I love ya, man!</h2>
