<p><a href="http://www.macminute.com/2005/06/06/icab3/">iCab 3 Beta Web browser released</a>: &#8220;The first public beta version of iCab 3 is now available for download, notes MacUpdate&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>(Via <a href="http://www.macminute.com/">MacMinute</a>.)</p>

<p>A friend of mine at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">CERIAS</a> told me he loved iCab&#8217;s ability to alter Javascript functionality, but the fact that it could barely do CSS1 pretty much made it useless nowadays.  It looks like things may have improved somewhat based on <a href="http://www.icab.de/screenshots.html">the recent screenshots</a>.</p>
