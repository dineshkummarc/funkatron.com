<p>So <a href="https://www.phparch.com/">php|architect</a> is having their <a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/page/index.php/7dox">CRAZY ANNUAL MEGAMEGAMEGA-SALE</a> this week, with 7 days of savings.  Today you can pick up their <a href="http://www.phparch.com/shop_product.php?itemid=135">Zend PHP5 Certification Study Guide</a> for half-price, which I did.  Tomorrow you can buy <a href="http://www.phparch.com/shop_product.php?itemid=134">a pack of practice tests</a> for half-off, which is pretty cool too.  I&#8217;m hoping that the next day I can pay half-price to have <a href="http://benramsey.com/">Ben Ramsey</a> take my exam for me.</p>
