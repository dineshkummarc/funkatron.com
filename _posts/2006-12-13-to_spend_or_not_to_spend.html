<p>The <a href="http://macheist.com/">Macheist</a> folks have finally quit fucking around with fruity puzzles and just started selling software cheap.&nbsp; This is apparently their final hurrah before the whole thing sinks back into the primordial ooze from which flash sites are born.&nbsp; The deal they&#8217;re offering is pretty sweet: a bundle of 8 (and maybe 2 more) shareware apps that would cost nearly $300 individually for <b>$49</b>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a hot deal, and one I&#8217;d jump on&#8230; except the stuff I <i>really</i> want, I already own.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re offering:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>Delicious Library</b> - totally kickass, but I own it and don&#8217;t really need another copy for any reason.<br /></li><li><b>FotoMagic </b>- apparently lets you make fancy slideshows.&nbsp; Eh&#8230; not compelling.</li><li><b>Shapeshifter </b>- own it, but only one license, and it would make sense to have two for my two macs (I&#8217;m cheating right now)</li><li><b>DEVONthink personal </b>- one of those organization tools that I use for like a week and then end up never opening again</li><li><b>Disco </b>- a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/11/03/dissing-disco/3">wildy overhyped</a> CD/DVD burning tool that I don&#8217;t want to buy on principle</li><li><b>RapidWeaver </b>- A pretty fancy WYSIWYG web page authoring tool.&nbsp; Looks kinda cool, but it&#8217;s so outside of my usual workflow that I&#8217;m unsure if I&#8217;d ever need it</li><li><b>iClip 4</b> - a more kickass clipboard.&nbsp; Yeah, I just don&#8217;t do that much with the clipboard to make this worthwhile</li><li>One game from <b>Pangea </b>- All of their games look stupid, honestly.&nbsp; If it was a game from <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/">Ambrosia</a>, I&#8217;d totally be up on this</li></ul>

<p><br />If 5000 bundles are sold:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>NewsFire </b>- a desktop RSS reader that seemed pretty cool, but I already own NewsNewsWire and NewsFire wasn&#8217;t <i>that</i> much cooler.</li></ul>

<p><br />If 10000 bundles are sold:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>TextMate </b>- The best text editor I&#8217;ve ever used, period.&nbsp; I also already own it, but another license would keep me morally sound.<br /></li></ul>

<p>OTOH, 25% of the proceeds go to charity, and even as-is it&#8217;s probably worth $49 to me.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not a slam dunk for sure.</p>
