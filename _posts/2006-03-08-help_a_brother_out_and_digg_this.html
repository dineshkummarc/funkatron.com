<p>I rarely ask for assistance in any way from friends/readers, but this is one thing where you could really help out a lot.<br /><br /><b>Digg this bad boy:</b><br /><a href="http://www.digg.com/security/Is_Securing_Wireless_Networks_Too_Difficult_">http://www.digg.com/security/Is_Securin<wbr />g_Wireless_Networks_Too_Difficult_</a><br /><br />You do have to make an account to &#8220;digg&#8221; the story.  It&#8217;s a cool site anyway, so making an account might be a cool move regardless.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/136991.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/136991.html</a></em></p>
