<p>Now I am certainly sad to hear that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=586&e=1&cid=586&u=/nm/20030115/wl_nm/crime_britain_raid_dc">this guy 
was stabbed</a>, but didn&#8217;t they think that this might have been one of those rare times when packing heat would be necessary?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They did, the point (and whats now being investigated) is that this guy wasnt in ths swat/raiders - he was part of the inteligence wave i beleive, who entered after the swat when the people inside the flat were subdued.</p>

<h2>The question thats gotta be answered is: this man was stabbed an hour after they busted thru the door, why were the prisions a) still in the flat b) not incapcitated?</h2>
