<blockquote>Liberals hate George Bush, and no matter what he does, they’ll use anything and anyone to get at him. I don’t hate the man. <strong>I voted for him</strong>. I want him to succeed, but more than that, I want to be safe, feel safe, and I don’t. <strong>The federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina has been an epic and humiliating embarrassment.</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>I’m ashamed of this country and its bumbling leadership today. Bush and Co. are going to catch he** from all angles, including the race angle, and I hope they catch it good, too. Billions we spend, and all we have to show for it are four-day-old corpses on the side of the road, starving and injured people, and women and children being raped by animals who shouldn’t even be alive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even Republicans were criticizing Bush and his administration for the sluggish relief effort. &#8220;I think it puts into question all of the Homeland Security and Northern Command planning for the last four years, because if we can&#8217;t respond faster than this to an event we saw coming across the Gulf for days, then why do we think we&#8217;re prepared to respond to a nuclear or biological attack?&#8221; said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</blockquote>
