		<div class="comment-body"><h2>I got one of those (well, the cheap chinese import version). It was pretty cool to have two old 120gb EIDE&#8217;s as portable storage. But it was cranky from the very begining, and now, sheesh &#8230;. it takes like 15mins to get the thing to work. Plug in, un plug, replug, unplug, replug &#8230;. cross fingers as it tries to recognise &#8230; unplug, replug, power on, power off. Maybe this new one is better. :)</h2>
