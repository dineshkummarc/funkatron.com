<blockquote>Looks like wxPHP development has started up again ( not that there was anything there before&#8230; ), and 2 days ago the first commit to cvs was done ( no: nothing there yet, but at least the work has been started ). Been a while since this was first announced, would still like to see this project up and running since wxWidgets is a very nice toolkit ( and just about every other language got bindings to it ).</blockquote>

Sometimes I wonder if people aren&#8217;t pressing PHP into areas where it doesn&#8217;t work out so hot.  It of course works very well for web apps, and seems decent when I&#8217;ve used it for shell scripting, but I wonder if it really lends itself to desktop GUI dev.  Then again, I&#8217;ve never tried it, so I could just be talking out of my ass.</p>
