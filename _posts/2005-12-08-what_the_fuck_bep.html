<p>Man, I liked <i>Elephunk</i> quite a bit, but how the fuck can I buy a goddamn album with that &#8220;My Humps&#8221; song on it?  I heard it once a couple weeks back, but there was no way I could ID it as BEP &#8212; it sounds like some shite 1-hit wonder out of Miami.  Jesus Christ guys, do you give a fuck at all anymore?<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/127925.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/127925.html</a></em></p>
