<blockquote><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000843045537/">Nintendo Revolution&rsquo;s classic Nintendo games will be free - Joystiq - www.joystiq.com</a>

Wow. Good move. When we spoke with Nintendo about the price of their classic &lsquo;emulated&rsquo; games on the Revolution, they were coy and left the pricing up to our imaginations. I assumed they&rsquo;d follow the GBA model &mdash; 10-12 bucks for a classic would be fair. But George Harrison of Nintendo just sprung a surprise. Classic Nintendo titles will be free. Buy the console, take it home, plug it in and start playing your old faves. They&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to offer too much out of the gate. After all, you want people to spend money on the software. But as far as exciting services to offer with their new hardware, it&rsquo;s hard to come up with a better idea.</blockquote>
