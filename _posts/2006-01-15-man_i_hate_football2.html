<p>Well, I hate it when I&#8217;m emotionally attached.  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=260115011">Indy losing today</a> really put me in a shitty mood, and now the Bears are down 13-0 in the 2nd quarter.  It makes me wonder if I should try to watch any more, because it&#8217;s <em>really</em> affected me &#8212; depressed state of mind, tons of muscle tension, etc.  Bleah.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/130991.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/130991.html</a></em></p>
