<p>The first official release of Otacon <a href="http://otacon.sourceforge.net">DBForms2</a>, v0.1, is now available from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/otacon/">SourceForge</a>.  This is a developers preview release, to give interested parties an idea of the direction DBForms2 is headed.  It is by no means feature-complete, and the application may change dramatically before reaching 1.0 status.  Please see the included TO-DO.txt file for more information on future plans.</p>
