		<div class="comment-body"><p>hello 
a link I once put on my blog, is haunting me.
&#8220;nice statue&#8221; the set design with black statue.
somehow you have set my  blog as original source ! and generated many hits on my blog, but allso made statistics useless, because not any of my visitors, thorugh you, are intrested in art ( but in whats in that link ), witch dissapoint boths sides - me and the visitors. Would you be so kind, to chance ( however you did it ) so my blog is not the source ! I can appriciate the fun in the picture, but now I&#8217;v seen the effect since oktober, of your linking, and prefer not to be attach to this anymore.</p>

<h2>bedst, zoe</h2>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think this is something I have control over.  I never linked to your site, so there is nothing for me to change or &#8220;turn off&#8221;.  I suspect that, if you linked to the picture in a post on your own site, search engines (maybe Google Image Search) are associating that picture with your blog.  That&#8217;s the only way I can imagine the image itself becoming the referrer.</p>

<p>I enjoyed your blog!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Honestly, I have no idea.  If I can sort out something to help, I&#8217;ll definitely do it, but right now I can&#8217;t see anything I can do on my end.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry!</p>
