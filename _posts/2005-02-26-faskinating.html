<p><a href="http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20050220-suicidal.html">I had a client come in with PA problems. He said it was really irritated and that the aftercare was extremely embarrassing. When asked what was he was doing, he told me he had other people urinating on his piercing. He had read that urine was sterile and flushed out the piercing&#8230; but he didn’t realize that it’s his own urine, not other people’s.</a><br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/89812.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/89812.html</a></em></p>
