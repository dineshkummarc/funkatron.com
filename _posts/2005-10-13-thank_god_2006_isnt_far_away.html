<blockquote>RUSSERT: And Matt, the most astounding number in this: 2 percent – just 2 percent - of African-Americans give George Bush a positive rating for his performance as President. The memories of Katrina very much in their minds.<br /><br />LAUER: Is that what this is all about? I mean, obviously that is just a startling number, 2 percent of African-Americans. Is this all about the aftermath of Katrina?<br /><br />RUSSERT: Well, the imagery of that along with the economy and fuel prices and Iraq, but that event, Matt, really did have a searing effect. George Bush and the Republican Party has tried very hard to reach out to African-American voters, but this is a very dramatic setback. <strong>I cannot find a pollster who can remember any President ever getting just 2 percent approval from African-Americans.</strong></blockquote>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9672058/" target="_blank">Bush approval dips below 40 percent</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>For the first time in the poll, Bush’s approval rating has sunk below 40 percent, while <strong>the percentage believing the country is heading in the right direction has dipped below 30 percent.</strong> In addition, a sizable plurality prefers a Democratic-controlled Congress, and just 29 percent think Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers is qualified to serve on the nation’s highest court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Americans know a lot about Christianity as more than 80 percent identify with that religion. We understand that orthodox Christians do not lie, put their personal fortune above the common good, or believe that the ends justify the means. Proper Christians operate by the ethical equivalent of the Marques of Queensbury rules. Most believe that it’s not whether you win or lose but how you play the game.<br /><br />But George W. Bush plays by his own rules. As American watch this administration unravel – as the electorate begins to understand the folly of the Iraq occupation, the fantasy of homeland security, and the abandonment of governance in the pursuit of political gain – one wonders which realization will come first: Will it be that Bush the President is incapable of leading the U.S., or will it be that <strong>Bush the man doesn’t deserve to be called a Christian?</strong></blockquote>
