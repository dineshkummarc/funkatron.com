<blockquote><p>Isn&#8217;t punk all about taking without permission? Or does that not apply when you don&#8217;t like the folks doing the taking? Lighten up, Discord.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, Kottke, when McDonalds (or whatever corporation you find particularly distasteful) makes a website called &#8220;hottke.org&#8221; where they blog about fine beef and potato products, you let me know how you feel.</p>

<p>Really, please, don&#8217;t talk about shit you don&#8217;t know.  You clearly know nothing of Discord, and little of &#8220;punk&#8221; culture, so better to keep your mouth shut on such topics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You could make the argument that hip-hop with it&#8217;s sample-based culture is about appropriating on the sly.  I don&#8217;t really see that in punk, although the two cultures do have more in common than one would first imagine.</p>
