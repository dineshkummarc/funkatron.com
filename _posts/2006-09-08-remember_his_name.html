<blockquote>One day, God willing, Russell Baer was going to tell his son this story. One day, after the boy&#8217;s heart and brain had healed, he was going to point to that picture on the kid&#8217;s bedroom shelf of the man doing a handstand on the roof of a house, take a deep breath and say, <em>Mav, that&#8217;s a man who lived a life as pure and died a death as muddy as any man ever to walk this rock, and I was there for both. That&#8217;s the man, when your heart stopped for an hour and they slit you open neck to navel, who I prayed to because &#8230; well, because you wouldn&#8217;t exist if he hadn&#8217;t died, and I wouldn&#8217;t be half of who I am if he hadn&#8217;t taught me how to live. That&#8217;s Pat Tillman, the man you take your middle name from, and I&#8217;ve been waiting for you to ask since the day you were born.</em><br /><br />Russ never got that chance: Maverick Patrick Baer died on Monday. So now Russ has Pat&#8217;s story stuck in his heart&#8230;. </blockquote>
