<p>Well, I upgraded to WP1.5.  Looks good in general, although there&#8217;s some funkiness with moving your old layout to the new system, so I&#8217;m sticking with the default theme for now.  It makes me feel like I should own a Mac mini.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I might start posting here again.  Like, more than just what I&#8217;m posting now.</p>
