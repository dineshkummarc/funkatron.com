<p>If you use Movable Type and are on OS X, you <b>have</b> to check out <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php">Kung-Log</a>, a really smooth desktop app that lets you administrate your blog without using a web browser.  I definitely like writing posts in it better than the web interface, and by using it I bypass all the stupid problems my host has with their CGI install.</p>
