<p>Interesting development.  Then again, didn&#8217;t Sun makes some &#8220;partnership&#8221; moves with Zend a while back?  Haven&#8217;t heard much from that lately.</p>

<p>IBM came in and sold Purdue&#8217;s IT department on Websphere, so if this does pan out, it may mean more interest and opportunities for PHP on campups.  That would be nice.</p>

<blockquote>Zend Core for IBM will be a seamless, out-of-the-box PHP development and production environment, based on PHP 5 technology. The product includes tight integration with IBM Cloudscape database server, DB2 and native support for XML and Web Services - supporting increased adoption of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). It delivers an unprecedented rapid development and deployment foundation for database driven applications and offers an upgrade path from the easy-to-use, lightweight Cloudscape database to the mission critical DB2, by providing a consistent API to developers.

Zend Core for IBM will be available in the second quarter of 2005 as a free download via the DB2 and Cloudscape product site and IBM&#8217;s developer portal, developerWorks via this easy-to-use package, PHP development or production servers can be setup within minutes. Additionally, a new PHP technology area will be introduced within IBM developerWorks to assist developers as they adopt PHP and IBM technologies for their applications. Zend Core for IBM support and updates will be made available directly from Zend Technologies. This offering will be compatible with existing products such as Zend Platform and Zend Studio. IBM is also planning to support Zend Core for IBM with the latest version of Informix Dynamic Server (IDS).</blockquote></li>
