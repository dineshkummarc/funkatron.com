		<div class="comment-body"><h2>Any chance of presenting this outside of CERIAS? I am sitting in San Francisco right now at SecurityOpus which I help run and we are always looking for new speakers. I would also recommend DefCon, ToorCon, CanSecWest and ShmooCon as places to speak to the hacker community on your topic of expertise.</h2>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d love to!  The main issue is travel and accommodations, as I don&#8217;t have the personal funds or the outside funding to do so.  I will be happy to present at any conference that can provide those things.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Pretty much every non-academic conference funds airfare and accomodations as well as attendenace at the conference itself. We are looking at potential candidates for the next time we hold SecurityOpus and I am on the hunt for more academic based speakers to contrast against those in the industry. More to come later.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Cool.  There are a ton of folks doing good work associated with CERIAS, so keep me in the loop.  We post relevant CFPs and event listings as well &#8212; send them to webmaster [AT] cerias.purdue.edu for now, until we get a better submission system going.  We&#8217;re trying to interface a lot more with the non-academic community, so I&#8217;m all about exploring places we can work together.</p>
